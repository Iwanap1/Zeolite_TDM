All the reagents used were of analytical grade; Sigma-Aldrich supplied all of the chemicals (St. Louis, MO, USA): methanol (purity >99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), n-heptane (99% pure), zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). The commercial zeolite, NH4-ZSM-5 was purchased from Zeolyst International. <header>Catalyst preparation<text>The NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite was calcined at 550 C under a steady flow of air for 6 h to convert it to H-ZSM-5 as a catalyst support for the production of biodiesel. The modification of H-ZSM-5 zeolite was carried out by desilication (following zeolite synthesis, silicon is extracted from the framework using alkaline treatment) at 80 C for 4 h with a series of NaOH concentrations (0.1\u20130.3 M) under atmospheric pressure. In a reflux condenser-equipped flask, a 30-milliliter solution of NaOH was heated to 80 C, then pre-determined amount of H-ZSM-5 zeolite (550 C calcined) was added and agitated for 4 h at 600 rpm. After desilication with an alkaline solution, deionized water was used to wash the suspension before it was filtered, dried for 8 h at 120 C and Na+/NH4+ ion exchange was then performed using 1 M NH4NO3 at 120 C for 4 h (ion exchange was carried out twice, one after the other with 1 M NH4NO3). The mixture was then cooled before being centrifuged at 780 rpm. The precipitate generated was purified by washing it three times with distilled water to get rid of any impurities. After drying for 10 h at 120 C, the reaction mixture was calcined in a muffle furnace for a total of 6 h at 550 C. The resulting desilicated zeolite sample was denoted as ZSM-5(concentration), where concentration denotes the concentration of the NaOH used in the alkaline treatment. The wet impregnation approach was used to prepare the ZrO2/ZSM-5 catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by slowly adding pre-determined amount of zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate as a precursor for zirconia, and an appropriate amount of ZSM-5 to 12 ml of distilled water and agitating it at 60 C for 3 h. The precipitate that formed was dried for 11 h at a temperature of 120 C. Finally, the synthesized catalyst was calcined for 6 h at 550 C and was denoted as ZrO2/ZSM-5. The ZrO2/ZSM-5(NaOH solution concentration) catalyst was also synthesized by a similar approach utilizing desilicated zeolite ZSM-5(NaOH solution concentration) as a support."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"zeolite_source\": {\n    \"source\": \"commercial\",\n    \"did_step\": \"true\",\n    \"name\": \"NH4-ZSM-5\",\n    \"supplier\": \"Zeolyst International\",\n    \"form\": \"\",\n    \"cbv\": \"\",\n    \"Si/Al\": \"\",\n    \"SiO2/Al2O3\": \"\",\n    \"M\": \"\",\n    \"Si/M\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"post_synthesis\": [\n    {\n      \"process\": \"calcination\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"gas\": \"air\",\n      \"gas_flow\": \"steady\",\n      \"heat_rate\": \"\",\n      \"temperature\": \"550 C\",\n      \"time\": \"6 h\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"solvent_etching\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"mass_parent\": \"\",\n      \"solutes\": \"NaOH (0.1 M)\",\n      \"solvent\": \"(30-milliliter)\",\n      \"temperature\": \"80 C\",\n      \"time\": \"4 h\",\n      \"microwave\": \"not used\",\n      \"ultrasound\": \"not used\",\n      \"repeats\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"ion_exchange\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"initial_form\": \"Na\",\n      \"final_form\": \"NH4\",\n      \"solutes\": \"NH4NO3 (1 M)\",\n      \"temperature\": \"120 C\",\n      \"time\": \"4 h\",\n      \"solvent\": \"\",\n      \"repeats\": \"2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"calcination\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"gas\": \"\",\n      \"gas_flow\": \"\",\n      \"heat_rate\": \"\",\n      \"temperature\": \"550 C\",\n      \"time\": \"6 h\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97 wt%) was the alkali source and hexamethonium bromide (HMBr2, 98 wt%) was the structure directing agent (SDA). Dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride solution (C26H58ClNO3Si, 40 wt% in methanol, containing (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane) was used as the organosilane reagent, labeled as TPOAC. Potassium bromide (KBr, 99 %) was used for FT-IR test. SiO2 gel was purchased from Shanghai Sigma-Aldrich Trading Co. Ltd. Sodium aluminate was supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Other chemical reagents were provided by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (China). All reagents were directly used without any further treatment. Distilled water was purchased from Watsons. <header>Zeolites synthesis<text>The molar composition of gel precursor for synthesizing parent EU-1 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 60, i.e., Si/Al = 30) was 8 Na2O : 1 Al2O3 : 60 SiO2 : 6 HMBr2 : 1765 H2O. The detailed procedure was described as follows: 2.7 g SiO2 gel was first dropped in 6.48 g distilled water at ambient temperature, which was then mixed homogeneously with stirring at 550 rpm and 60 C. The Na-type EU-1, with mass percentage of 0.2 % based on the weight of gel precursor, was used as the crystal seeds and added into the above mixture to shorten the crystallization time. This mixed solution was recorded as solution A. After precrystallization for 3 h, 0.049 g NaAlO2, 0.172 g NaOH and 0.651 g HMBr2 were dissolved in distilled water and mixed well, which was recorded as solution B. Then the solution B was dropped into solution A, and the mixture was continued to stir for another 3 h. Then the gel precursor was poured into a Teflon-sealed stainless-steel reactor for crystallization at 170 C for 72 h. Afterwards, the resulting solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times, finally dried at 100 C overnight. In order to reduce the crystal sizes of EU-1 zeolite, the organosilane reagent (with the amount of 0.15 g or 0.30 g, corresponding to 1.3 % or 2.6 % of the total mass of gel precursor) was slowly dropped into the solution A to functionalize the protozeolitic units. The other procedures followed the same for the synthesis of the parent zeolite. The solution A obtained under different synthesis conditions were abbreviated as 0\u201360 C-3 h-SA, 0.15\u201360 C-3 h-SA and 0.30\u201360 C-3 h-SA. The gel precursors comprised solution A and solution B were recorded as 0\u201360 C-6 h-G, 0.15\u201360 C-6 h-G and 0.30\u201360 C-6 h-G, respectively (0, 0.15 and 0.30 represented the addition amount of TPOAC). In order to study the variation of relative crystallinities and morphologies of zeolite samples prepared with different crystallization time, the gel precursors were hydrothermally treated for various time periods (24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively). The samples obtained with different crystallization time were labelled as 0-EU-1\u201324 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201336 h, 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h, etc. The SDA of these zeolite samples was not removed. The 0-EU-1\u201372 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h and 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h zeolite samples were calcined at 550 C for 8 h to remove the organic template, and the suffix \u201ccal\u201d was included in the abbreviation to indicate the SDA of zeolite was removed by calcination (e.g., 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h-cal, Na-type zeolites). These Na-type zeolites were converted into NH4-type zeolites by ion exchanging with 1 M NH4Cl solution at 90 C for 2 h, and this process was repeated for three times. The white solid products were separated from the mixed solution by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times. The precipitates were dried in the oven at 80 C for 10 h and then calcined at 550 C for 5 h to obtain the H-type zeolites. The suffix \u201cH\u201d indicated that the zeolite sample was obtained by ion exchange (e.g., 0-EU-1-H).

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97 wt%) was the alkali source and hexamethonium bromide (HMBr2, 98 wt%) was the structure directing agent (SDA). Dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride solution (C26H58ClNO3Si, 40 wt% in methanol, containing (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane) was used as the organosilane reagent, labeled as TPOAC. Potassium bromide (KBr, 99 %) was used for FT-IR test. SiO2 gel was purchased from Shanghai Sigma-Aldrich Trading Co. Ltd. Sodium aluminate was supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Other chemical reagents were provided by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (China). All reagents were directly used without any further treatment. Distilled water was purchased from Watsons. <header>Zeolites synthesis<text>The molar composition of gel precursor for synthesizing parent EU-1 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 60, i.e., Si/Al = 30) was 8 Na2O : 1 Al2O3 : 60 SiO2 : 6 HMBr2 : 1765 H2O. The detailed procedure was described as follows: 2.7 g SiO2 gel was first dropped in 6.48 g distilled water at ambient temperature, which was then mixed homogeneously with stirring at 550 rpm and 60 C. The Na-type EU-1, with mass percentage of 0.2 % based on the weight of gel precursor, was used as the crystal seeds and added into the above mixture to shorten the crystallization time. This mixed solution was recorded as solution A. After precrystallization for 3 h, 0.049 g NaAlO2, 0.172 g NaOH and 0.651 g HMBr2 were dissolved in distilled water and mixed well, which was recorded as solution B. Then the solution B was dropped into solution A, and the mixture was continued to stir for another 3 h. Then the gel precursor was poured into a Teflon-sealed stainless-steel reactor for crystallization at 170 C for 72 h. Afterwards, the resulting solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times, finally dried at 100 C overnight. In order to reduce the crystal sizes of EU-1 zeolite, the organosilane reagent (with the amount of 0.15 g or 0.30 g, corresponding to 1.3 % or 2.6 % of the total mass of gel precursor) was slowly dropped into the solution A to functionalize the protozeolitic units. The other procedures followed the same for the synthesis of the parent zeolite. The solution A obtained under different synthesis conditions were abbreviated as 0\u201360 C-3 h-SA, 0.15\u201360 C-3 h-SA and 0.30\u201360 C-3 h-SA. The gel precursors comprised solution A and solution B were recorded as 0\u201360 C-6 h-G, 0.15\u201360 C-6 h-G and 0.30\u201360 C-6 h-G, respectively (0, 0.15 and 0.30 represented the addition amount of TPOAC). In order to study the variation of relative crystallinities and morphologies of zeolite samples prepared with different crystallization time, the gel precursors were hydrothermally treated for various time periods (24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively). The samples obtained with different crystallization time were labelled as 0-EU-1\u201324 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201336 h, 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h, etc. The SDA of these zeolite samples was not removed. The 0-EU-1\u201372 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h and 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h zeolite samples were calcined at 550 C for 8 h to remove the organic template, and the suffix \u201ccal\u201d was included in the abbreviation to indicate the SDA of zeolite was removed by calcination (e.g., 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h-cal, Na-type zeolites). These Na-type zeolites were converted into NH4-type zeolites by ion exchanging with 1 M NH4Cl solution at 90 C for 2 h, and this process was repeated for three times. The white solid products were separated from the mixed solution by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times. The precipitates were dried in the oven at 80 C for 10 h and then calcined at 550 C for 5 h to obtain the H-type zeolites. The suffix \u201cH\u201d indicated that the zeolite sample was obtained by ion exchange (e.g., 0-EU-1-H). To study the interaction between TPOAC and Al species, the verified experiment was proceeded under the same conditions for synthesizing parent EU-1 zeolite.

Therefore, TEOS molecules are not able to enter the internal micropores of zeolite particles during chemical liquid deposition, only grafting on the hydroxyl group over external surface, thus ultimately the formation of SiO2 layer after high temperature calcination will not block the internal micropore structure of zeolite particles."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"zeolite_source\": {\n    \"source\": \"hydrothermal crystallization\",\n    \"did_step\": \"true\",\n    \"components\": \"Tetraethyloxysilane (TEOS, 98%) | aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3.9H2O, >99%) | tetrapropyl-ammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M in H2O) | (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES, 98%)\",\n    \"gel_composition\": \"100 SiO2: 1 Al2O3: 1500 TEOS: 25 TPAOH: 5 APTES: 2500 H2O\",\n    \"seed\": \"\",\n    \"ratios\": \"SiO2/Al2O3 = 60 | Si/Al = 30\",\n    \"pH\": \"\",\n    \"pH_adjusted_with\": \"\",\n    \"temperature\": \"443 K\",\n    \"time\": \"120 h\",\n    \"tumbling\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"post_synthesis\": [\n    {\n      \"process\": \"calcination\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"gas\": \"\",\n      \"gas_flow\": \"\",\n      \"heat_rate\": \"\",\n      \"temperature\": \"873 K\",\n      \"time\": \"8 h\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"chemical liquid deposition\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"mass_parent\": \"\",\n      \"solutes\": \"TEOS (SiO2/ZSM-5 = 5 wt%)\",\n      \"solvent\": \"n-hexane\",\n      \"temperature\": \"333 K\",\n      \"time\": \"2 h\",\n      \"microwave\": \"\",\n      \"ultrasound\": \"\",\n      \"repeats\": \"6\",\n      \"repeated_with_calcination\": \"true\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"process\": \"calcination\",\n      \"did_step\": \"true\",\n      \"gas\": \"\",\n      \"gas_flow\": \"\",\n      \"heat_rate\": \"\",\n      \"temperature\": \"873 K\",\n      \"time\": \"6 h\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

Y_micr was acid-washed with a 10 wt% citric acid solution to fragilize the structure, using 2 mL of solution (i.e., ca. 1 mmol of citric acid) for 1 g of zeolite. After around 17 h under stirring at room temperature (RT), the solid was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight. In the case of ZSM5_micr, before desilication, the structure was fragilized in two consecutive steps: first the zeolite was dispersed in a NaOH solution (1 M, 4 mL per gram of zeolite), stirred for 1 h at 80 C and then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight; subsequently, the resulting powder was dispersed in a H2SO4 solution (0.6 M, 4 mL per gram of zeolite) for 3 h at 80 C, under stirring and finally recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight. The pre-treated Y and ZSM5 zeolites were then used to prepare the hierarchical structures through the surfactant-mediated desilication process. Typically, a dispersion was prepared with the ratio of 64 mL of a NaOH solution (0.37 M) and 0.7 g of CTAB for each gram of zeolite. After stirring for 20 min at RT and adjusting the pH to 11 with a 2 M HCl solution, the dispersion (ca. 25 mL) was transferred into a 50 mL stainless steel PTFE-lined autoclave and heated at 150 C under autogenous pressure for 6 h. The obtained solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight at 110 C.<header>Preparation of metal-exchanged zeolites<text>For the preparation of the metal-exchanged zeolites, Ni and Cu ions were inserted into the porous structure of both parent (Y_micr and ZSM5_micr) and hierarchical zeolites (Y_hier and ZSM5_hier) via an ion-exchange procedure. In a typical procedure, 1 g of the starting zeolite was suspended in 50 mL of a solution containing both metal precursors (nitrates), each at a concentration equal to 0.001 M, and stirred at 300 rpm for 24 h at RT. The obtained solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried at 80 C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 350 C for 4 h.<header>Preparation of the modified electrodes<text>In order to test the metal-exchanged zeolites as electrocatalysts for GEOR, they were used for the preparation of the zeolite-modified electrodes.

Before use, the parent Na-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (coded as \u201cparent\u201d) was converted to the ammonium form of zeolite (NH4-ZSM-5) by three consecutive ion exchange steps using 2.0 M NH4NO3 solution ( 1 g Z e o l i t e 20 m l N H 4 N O 3 ) for 3 h at 75 C. The powder was then calcined for 4 h at 550 C to obtain the H-form zeolite (H-ZSM-5). The M/ZSM-5 catalysts (M: Fe, Ga, Zr, Ce, and La) were synthesized by treating the parent with NH4HF2/metal solution. The experiment is described using Fe metal as an example. A mixture with a 2:3 M ratio of Fe(NO3)3: NH4HF2 and Fe/Al ratio of 1 was dispersed in 250 ml of deionized water and the dispersion obtained was then added to a known amount of the parent powder.

Before use, the parent Na-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (coded as \u201cparent\u201d) was converted to the ammonium form of zeolite (NH4-ZSM-5) by three consecutive ion exchange steps using 2.0 M NH4NO3 solution ( 1 g Z e o l i t e 20 m l N H 4 N O 3 ) for 3 h at 75 C. The powder was then calcined for 4 h at 550 C to obtain the H-form zeolite (H-ZSM-5). The M/ZSM-5 catalysts (M: Fe, Ga, Zr, Ce, and La) were synthesized by treating the parent with NH4HF2/metal solution. The experiment is described using Fe metal as an example. A mixture with a 2:3 M ratio of Fe(NO3)3: NH4HF2 and Fe/Al ratio of 1 was dispersed in 250 ml of deionized water and the dispersion obtained was then added to a known amount of the parent powder. After stirring for 10 min, a uniform solution was obtained, which was refluxed for 24 h at 90 C at 240 rpm under the lab hood. After cooling the mixture at ambient temperature, the solid was filtered, washed thoroughly with hot deionized water, and dried at 100 C for 4 h. Finally, the sample was calcined at 600 C for 4 h.

The KOH and Al2(SO4)3\u00b718H2O were mixed and dissolved in deionized water first, then DAH and silica sol were dropped into the mechanical agitator and stirred vigorously to obtain the precursor gel with mole ratios of SiO2: Al2O3: DAH: OH-: H2O = 1.0: 0.011: 0.4: 0.25: 35.0. The obtained precursor gel was moved into a Teflon autoclave, followed by dynamic crystallization at 160 C and 90 r/min for 34 h. After crystallization, the samples were centrifuged (three times) and dried (110 C) after being cooled to room temperature, followed by calcination at 600 C for 10 h to remove the DAH template. After that, the ZSM-22 sample and 1 M NH4NO3 solution were packed into a three-necked flask and ion-exchanged for 8 h at 80 C to obtain the acid ZSM-22 zeolite, which was denoted as the Z22-D sample. The hierarchical ZSM-22 zeolites were synthesized with almost the same process as that of the Z22-D sample, except that PHMB was employed as the only template instead of DAH and the addition amount of PHMB was SiO2/xPHMB, in which x = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.003.

The reaction mixture was prepared through the following steps: (i) dissolution of sodium aluminate in one-third of the total water required for the synthesis (Solution I), (ii) dilution of sodium hydroxide in one-third of the water (Solution II), (iii) mix Solution I and II, then add the colloidal silica under stirring at 200 rpm at 50 C for 1 h (Solution III), (iv) gradually add the suspension of NH4FER seed crystals (previously dispersed in one-third of the water) in Solution III until complete homogenization, (v) add the Luviquat polymer to the remaining solution, maintaining the same agitation conditions, temperature, and time as in step (iii). The obtained synthesis gel was subsequently dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h and then crushed in a stainless-steel analytical knife mill. The dried and ground gel was carefully placed in an open Teflon vessel attached to a support (Fig. 1 (a)). This container was then inserted into a hermetically sealed Teflon vessel, which contained at the bottom 2 g of an EDA solution in distilled water mixed at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) for every 1 g of dry gel, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The set was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave (Fig. 1(c)) and heated in an oven at 160 C for 24 h.

The hierarchical HZSM-5 was prepared by the desilication approach using NaOH solution according to the previous literature reports [42,43]. First, calcination of the HZSM-5 was performed in muffle furnace at 550 C for 6 h to obtain the protonic form of ZSM-5. Then, the calcined zeolite was treated by the NaOH solutions with varying concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M. In this step, 5 g of calcined ZSM-5 was added into 150 mL NaOH solution, and stirred at 65 C for 30 min. After that, the desilication treated ZSM-5 was washed by deionized water to neutral. At last, the desilication treated ZSM-5 was ion exchanged in aqueous 1.0 M NH4NO3 solution at 50 C for 2 h, and then dried and calcined again to obtain acidic H-form of hierarchical HZSM-5. The HZSM-5 pretreated by varying concentrations of NaOH solution was named as Z-0.1 M, Z-0.3 M, Z-0.5 M, and Z-0.7 M, respectively.

Briefly, the precursor solution with a molar composition of Al2O3: 80SiO2: 6K2O: 17.5DAH:2025 H2O was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor and crystallized at 160 C for 48 h under autogenous pressure. Finally, the solid product was filtered, dried and calcined in air conditions at 560 C for 8 h. Calcined sample (denoted as KZ22) was repeatedly exchanged with the aqueous solution of NH4Cl at 80 C (3 \u00d7 3 h, 50 mL of a solution per 1 g of zeolite), washed with deionized water, dried at 120 C for 12 h. The ion-exchanged sample was labeled as NZ22. Then, the protonated zeolite ZSM-22 (Z22) was derived by calcining zeolite NZ22 as obtained at 450 C for 4 h without any further post-treatments. The controllable desilication treatment was carried out by introducing the NZ22 sample in the aqueous solution consisting cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd.) and NaOH solution of different concentrations at 80 C for 10 h. After this procedure, the resulting solid was washed using deionized water until pH neutral and dried at 60 C for 24 h. Then, the samples were treated in an aqueous solution of 0.1 HCl at 80 C for 2 h. The Na ions were entirely removed from the solid products by exchanging with 0.5 M NH4Cl for 3 times. Finally, the samples were dried overnight and calcined in a furnace at 550 C for 4 h. The protonic samples were denoted as CZ22-015, CZ22-03, and CZ22-045, according to the NaOH concentrations (0.15 M, 0.3 M, and 0.45 M) in the desilication solution.

The zeolite (ultrastable CBV712) has been supplied by Zeolyst International in the ammonium form with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 12. The first catalyst (Cat-A) has been prepared using the zeolite without being submitted to any desilication treatment. The second one (Cat-B), has been prepared after submitting the zeolite to a desilication treatment (detailed below), whereas the third one (Cat-C) has been prepared after submitting twice the zeolite to the desilication treatment. The alkaline treatment method followed for zeolite desilication has consisted on [31]: i) suspension of 10 g in 300 mL of 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution and stirring for 15 min at room temperature; ii) neutralization of the suspension with an equivalent amount of 1.0 M HCl solution to quench the desilication treatment. No longer contact times are required since using an aqueous NaOH solution, most of the mesoporosity is developed in the first 15 min [41,42]; iii) the desilicated zeolite was filtered and washed with deionized water; iv) the zeolite was subjected to two subsequent ion exchange cycles of 24 h with a 0.50 M aqueous solution of NH4Cl at room temperature (zeolite/solution ratio of 1 g/5 mL), in order to ensure that the Na introduced during the leaching stage is totally removed. Lastly, v) the zeolite was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried in an oven at 110 C for 16 h, and calcined in a muffle at 550 C, using a heating ramp of 12 C min-1, and maintaining that temperature for 4 h. In all the cases, the incorporation of the metals (1 wt% of Pt and 0.5 wt% of Pd) has been carried out following the procedure described by Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [43]. The behavior of PtPd as a metal function to activate hydrogenation reactions is well established [44]. This bimetallic function offers advantages over each of the individual metals in terms of stability and higher conversion, due to its lower S retention. Moreover, the PtPd catalyst supported on HY zeolite is very stable and has an outstanding capacity for obtaining naphtha and medium distillates [43\u201345]. The catalysts have been extensively characterized in order to correlate their physicochemical properties with their catalytic behavior. In this way, the textural properties have been determined from the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. The crystalline structure of the supports has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The acidic properties have been measured by temperature-programmed desorption/cracking of tert-butylamine and by pyridine FTIR analysis. The composition of the catalysts and the metal content have been measured by wavelength dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, some TEM images have been acquired for characterizing in a higher extent the structure of the catalyst and for observing the metal dispersion. Finally, the coke deposited on the catalysts has been measured by temperature-programmed oxidation. The equipment used for each analysis, as well as the procedures followed are available in the Supplementary Material."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"zeolite_source\": {\n    \"source\": \"commercial\",\n    \"did_step\": \"true\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"supplier\": \"Zeolyst International\",\n    \"form\": \"NH4\",\n    \"cbv\": \"CBV712\",\n    \"Si/Al\": \"\",\n    \"SiO2/Al2O3\": \"12\",\n    \"M\": \"\",\n    \"Si/M\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"post_synthesis\": []\n}"}]}

In this study, the silica source used was fumed silica (Degussa, Aerosil 200), whereas the aluminum source employed was aluminum powder. Additionally, tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) (Aldrich, 35% aqueous solution) was utilized as the template agent. The precursor gel was composed of oxides with the following molar ratio: 30TEAOH: 50SiO2:Al2O3:750H2O. Aluminum metal was dissolved in a TEAOH-containing aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a transparent solution. Subsequently, this solution was introduced into a slurry composed of fumed silica and another portion of the TEAOH-containing aqueous solution. The aluminosilicate fluid gel that was created was agitated in a beaker at room temperature for 4 h. Following, it was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave. The process of crystallization was conducted at a temperature of 140 C in a rotational state at a speed of 60 rpm for 3 days. The autoclave was subjected to quenching to stop the crystallization reaction. The separation of the finished product from the liquid was achieved by using a centrifuge operating at a speed of 16,000 rpm. Subsequently, the separated product underwent a washing process using deionized water until the pH level reached a value lower than 9.0. Finally, the product was subjected to a drying procedure in an oven at a temperature of 110 C. The resultant solid sample was named as NB-NC (nano-beta non-calcinated) in which the TEAOH template was not burned off.<header>Hierarchical nanosized beta synthesis<text>Mesoporous nanosized beta zeolites were synthesized by employing two main strategies consisting of hydrothermal treatment (steaming) and base treatment methods for non-calcined (NB-NC) and calcined (NB-C) nanosized beta zeolites.

Subsequently, the recovered steamed solids were calcined at 600 C for 4 h to remove the organic agents and the resultant products were named as NB-NC-HT-C and NB-C-HT-C respectively. In the base treatment method, two kind of experiments were carried out as follow: 1) a mixture of 0.5 M ammonia and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was mixed with NB-C or NB-NC, 2) only 0.5 M ammonia was mixed with NB-C or NB-NC. The two experiments were conducted by using PTFE lined 140 ml autoclave, and heated in the oven at 150 C for 10 h. Then, the autoclave was quenched and the final solid product was separated from the liquid using a 12,000 rpm centrifugation.
