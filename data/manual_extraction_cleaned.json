        "text": "<header>Catalyst preparation<text>The hierarchical ZSM-5 was prepared through the post-treatment method using NaZSM-5 as parent zeolite (Si/Al = 13.5, Catalyst Plant of Nankai University). For the alkaline treatment, 3.33 g of NaZSM-5 zeolites were added into 100 ml NaOH solution (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 M) under stirring of 600 rpm and heated at 338 K for 0.5 h. After that, the mixture was quenched by adding distilled water, followed by filtration, washing to neutral with extensive distilled water, and drying at 333 K for 12 h. The zeolites obtained by alkaline treatment are expressed by NaZSM-5-OHx, where x is the concentration of NaOH. For the acid treatment, 1 g alkali-treated zeolite (or NaZSM-5 zeolite) was loaded into 100 ml 0.1 M HCl solution under stirring of 600 rpm and heated at 338 K for 6 h. Then, the resulting suspension was quenched, followed by filtration, washing, and drying in the same procedure as the alkaline treatment. The zeolites obtained by acid treatment are denoted by NaZSM-5-OHx-H (or NaZSM-5-H). All zeolites were ion-exchanged with 1 M NH4Cl solution at 353 K for 3 h, which was continuously carried out three times. Subsequently, the mixture was filtered, washed until no Cl- was detected (by adding AgNO3), and calcined at 823 K for 5 h in static air. Zeolite notations and modification conditions are summarized in Table S1. Cobalt-type (Co-type) zeolites were prepared to investigate the specific location of Al in the zeolite framework. Briefly, sodium-type (Na-type) zeolites were subjected to ion exchange in 0.05 M Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O solution at 353 K for 12 h. The ion-exchange process was repeated three times to ensure that the cobalt cations were in a (super)saturated state. The Co-type zeolites were dried overnight in an oven at 333 K, followed by calcination at 773 K for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere to dehydrate Co(H2O)6 2+ toward bare Co2+.",

Active metal species were introduced to Z via wetness impregnation. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O (Sigma Aldrich), zinc nitrate hexahydrate Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O (Alfa Aesar), and gallium nitrate hydrate Ga(NO3)3\u00b7xH2O (Sigma Aldrich) were used as Mo, Zn, and Ga precursors, respectively. Predetermined amounts of Z were added to aqueous solutions of each metal precursor with various nominal metal loadings and rigorously stirred for 1 h. Water was removed from the solutions using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Rotavapor R-300), and the remaining products were dried overnight in a 105 C heating oven. The samples were calcined at specific temperatures for 5 h depending on the introduced metal species (500 C for Mo and 550 C for Zn, Ga), using a ramping rate of 5 C/min. The obtained catalysts were nominated with respect to the loading of the active metal (e.g., 2Mo/Z represents the sample with 2 wt% Mo impregnated on Z). Note that this nomination does not indicate that the active metals were in their metallic form; rather, Mo, Zn, and Ga were present in their oxidized state following calcination.",

All the reagents used were of analytical grade; Sigma-Aldrich supplied all of the chemicals (St. Louis, MO, USA): methanol (purity >99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), n-heptane (99% pure), zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). The commercial zeolite, NH4-ZSM-5 was purchased from Zeolyst International. <header>Catalyst preparation<text>The NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite was calcined at 550 C under a steady flow of air for 6 h to convert it to H-ZSM-5 as a catalyst support for the production of biodiesel. The modification of H-ZSM-5 zeolite was carried out by desilication (following zeolite synthesis, silicon is extracted from the framework using alkaline treatment) at 80 C for 4 h with a series of NaOH concentrations (0.1\u20130.3 M) under atmospheric pressure. In a reflux condenser-equipped flask, a 30-milliliter solution of NaOH was heated to 80 C, then pre-determined amount of H-ZSM-5 zeolite (550 C calcined) was added and agitated for 4 h at 600 rpm. After desilication with an alkaline solution, deionized water was used to wash the suspension before it was filtered, dried for 8 h at 120 C and Na+/NH4+ ion exchange was then performed using 1 M NH4NO3 at 120 C for 4 h (ion exchange was carried out twice, one after the other with 1 M NH4NO3). The mixture was then cooled before being centrifuged at 780 rpm. The precipitate generated was purified by washing it three times with distilled water to get rid of any impurities. After drying for 10 h at 120 C, the reaction mixture was calcined in a muffle furnace for a total of 6 h at 550 C. The resulting desilicated zeolite sample was denoted as ZSM-5(concentration), where concentration denotes the concentration of the NaOH used in the alkaline treatment. The wet impregnation approach was used to prepare the ZrO2/ZSM-5 catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by slowly adding pre-determined amount of zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate as a precursor for zirconia, and an appropriate amount of ZSM-5 to 12 ml of distilled water and agitating it at 60 C for 3 h. The precipitate that formed was dried for 11 h at a temperature of 120 C. Finally, the synthesized catalyst was calcined for 6 h at 550 C and was denoted as ZrO2/ZSM-5. The ZrO2/ZSM-5(NaOH solution concentration) catalyst was also synthesized by a similar approach utilizing desilicated zeolite ZSM-5(NaOH solution concentration) as a support.",

Rare-earth salts, including lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (\u2265 99.5%), praseodymium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (\u2265 99.5%), neodymium nitrate hexahydrate (\u2265 99.5%), and samarium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (\u2265 99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Liquified isobutane (\u2265 99.9%) and 2-butene (\u2265 99.9%) were obtained from Dalian Airichem Specialty Gases & Chemicals Co., Ltd. <header>Catalyst preparation<text>The incorporation of rare-earth cations into X zeolite was achieved through a double-exchange, double-calcination approach. A typical procedure was conducted as follows: NaX zeolite was exchanged with 0.2 mol/L rare earth nitrate solution with a liquid-to-solid ratio of 20 mL g-1. The ion exchange process was conducted at 80 C for 2 h and repeated once. After filtration, washing, and drying at 120 C overnight, the resulting sample was calcined in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 0.5 C min-1 up to 450 C. After fully rehydrated, the procedure above was subsequently replicated to attain a significant level of ion exchange.",

        "text": "<header>Microwave (MW)-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment of ZSM-5<text>The parent ZSM-5 was calcined at 550 C for 5 h to convert it to an H-form counterpart before the treatment. The MW-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment was carried out in a mono-mode microwave reactor (Anton Paar, Monowave 300). Specifically, in a typical treatment, in a 30 mL quartz vessel, 1 g calcined parent ZSM-5 zeolite was dispersed in 20 mL chelation-alkaline medium with 0.2 M NaOH and x M Na2H2EDTA, (where x was 0, i.e., the conventional alkaline treatment without EDTA, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 M). Then, the vessel was sealed by a rubber cap and introduced into the MW reactor, heated to 65 C as quick as possible and maintained for y min (y = 3 and 30 min) under stirring at 800 rpm. Relevant samples from the post-treatment in this work are denoted as Z-MW-x-y accordingly. After the treatment, the vessel was taken out from the MW reactor immediately and cooled in an ice-water bath. Then, the resulting mixture was centrifuged (at 4400 rpm for 7 min) to separate the solid sample (from the mixture) which was washed using deionized water 4 times and dried in an oven at 100 C for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 1 a, a control sample was prepared as well by the conventional heating (using a water bath) under the hydrothermal condition at 65 C using the mixed solution with 0.3 M Na2H2EDTA and 0.2 NaOH aqueous solution for 30 min, and the resulting control sample was denoted as Z-HT-0.3\u201330. All the obtained ZSM-5 zeolites were ion-exchanged for catalysis. In detail, the as-prepared zeolite (1 g) was dispersed in 40 mL of 1 M NH4NO3 solution (1 M) in a flask. The mixture was heated by a water bath at 80 C for 12 h under stirring (at 500 rpm), then the solid was separated by centrifugation (at 4400 rpm for 7 min) and washed with deionized water four times. Ion exchange was repeated twice under the same condition, and then the zeolite samples were dried in an oven at 100 C for 12 h. Before catalysis, all the ion-exchanged zeolites were calcined in a muffle oven at 550 C for 5 h with a ramp rate of 5 C/min.",

The pristine HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 85) catalyst was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Plant (Tianjin, China), and it was denoted as H-Z5-1. Hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts were synthesized as explained below. First, the parent HZSM-5 was calcined in flowing air at 550 C for 4 h. Then, the calcined samples were treated with an alkaline solution with varying TPA+ concentrations of TPA+/OH- = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 for 1 h at 70 C. The concentration of OH- (C OH -) was maintained at 0.2 M, and the solution amount was kept at 30 mL g-1 parent HZSM-5 for alkaline treatment. These samples were denoted as H-Z5-2, H-Z5-3, H-Z5-4, H-Z5-5, and H-Z5-6, respectively. After alkaline treatment, the suspension was cooled down in an ice bath, centrifugated, and washed with deionized water until the pH = 7. The obtained powder was dried at 80 C for 12 h and calcined at 550 C for 4 h. The collected powder was then ion-exchanged three times with 0.5 M NH4NO3 at 80 C for 1 h. Finally, the resulting samples were centrifugated, washed, dried, and calcined as described above to obtain the hierarchical HZSM-5 catalysts. The obtained catalysts are shown in the following table - <R><C>Sample<C>Base<C>[ITALICS] C TPA+/OH-<C>[ITALICS] C OH-<C>[ITALICS] C AHFS<C>[ITALICS] T ( C)<C>t (h)<R><C>H-Z5-1<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<R><C>H-Z5-2<C>NaOH<C>0<C>0.2<C>\u2013<C>70<C>1<R><C>H-Z5-3<C>TPAOH&NaOH<C>0.25<C>0.2<C>\u2013<C>70<C>1<R><C>H-Z5-4<C>TPAOH&NaOH<C>0.5<C>0.2<C>\u2013<C>70<C>1<R><C>H-Z5-5<C>TPAOH&NaOH<C>0.75<C>0.2<C>\u2013<C>70<C>1<R><C>H-Z5-6<C>TPAOH<C>1<C>0.2<C>\u2013<C>70<C>1<R><C>AHFS0.01<C>AHFS<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>0.01<C>80<C>1<R><C>AHFS0.1<C>AHFS<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>0.1<C>80<C>1<R><C>AHFS0.1<C>AHFS<C>\u2013<C>\u2013<C>0.1<C>80<C>1<Cap>The synthesis of HZSM-5 catalysts.</Cap> . AHFS-treated HZSM-5 catalyst . AHFS treatment was performed on the H-Z5-1 and H-Z5-4 catalysts. 4 g of H-Z5-1 was treated with AHFS solutions (30 mL) of 0.01 and 0.1 M for 1 h at 80 C, and they were denoted as AHFS0.01-Z5-1 and AHFS0.1-Z5-1, respectively. In the same way, AHFS0.1-Z5-4 was obtained from treatment of H-Z5-4 treated using a 0.1 M AHFS solution. Then, the obtained products were centrifuged, washed, dried, and calcined according to the same procedure for synthesizing hierarchical HZSM-5 catalysts.

Synthesis of silicalite-1 (S1) with pure LAS (LAS-S1) . To synthesize S1 zeolite, 13 g TPAOH solution was added to deionized water under vigorous stirring. Then, 8.32 g tetraethyl orthosilicate was slowly added to the above mixture. When tetraethyl orthosilicate was fully dissolved, the clear reaction mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for crystallization at 170 C for 96 h. The molar composition of the synthesis solution was 0.4 TPAOH: 1.0 SiO2: 35 H2O. The as-synthesized solid products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol for three times, and then dried at 80 C for 12 h, followed by calcination at 550 C for 8 h (Wang et al., 2016). LAS-S1 catalyst was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of S1 with Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O for 24 h and the Al loading was 15 wt%. The catalyst was subsequently dried at 80 C under continuous stirring and 105 C for complete dryness. Finally, the dried catalysts were calcined at 550 C for 4 h.",

Ltd., which has similar acid content and physical property with hier-ZSM-5 (BZ5(30,50), Part 3.3) (Fu et al., 2021). Commercial raw RH was bought from a farm in Anhui province (China). A certain mass of commercial rice husks was dispersed into deionized water (solid\u2013liquid ratio = 1:50) and uniformly stirred at room temperature using an electric mixer to remove surface-attached impurities. After repeated treatment three times and following drying, the final sample was obtained.<header>Preparation of hier-ZSM-5 with different Na<text>Firstly, NaAlO2 and NaOH were dissolved in water and added to the mixed solution of TEOS and TPAOH, respectively. The molecular composition of the growth liquid was as follows: 60 SiO2: m Al2O3: 44 TPAOH: n Na2O: 11,975 H2O. After stirring the mixture for one minute, 5 g of the cleaned RH was added and stirred for 10 h, then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (volume of 100 mL) for zeolite crystallization at 170 C for 24 h. The Na-type ZSM-5 was filtered with deionized water until the catalyst filtrate was neutral, dried at 100 C, and calcined at 550 C for 6 h. To obtain H-type ZSM-5, the calcined Na-type ZSM-5 was ion-exchanged three times with 1 mol/L NH4Cl aqueous solution at 90 C for 1 h, and the H-hier-ZSM-5 was calcined at 550 C for 6 h. The obtained catalyst was named BZ5(X, Y); the X refers to the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (20, 30, 50, and 60) of the synthetic solution, while the Y refers to the ratio of Na2O/Al2O3 (0, 25, 50, and 75) in the growth solution.<header>Hier-ZSM-5 prepared by different crystallization manners<text>The above catalysts were all prepared by hydrothermal crystallization in static conditions. To compare the effects of different crystallization manners on the hier-ZSM-5, we set the rotation crystallization. The only difference between rotary crystallization and standing crystallization is that the final crystallization kettle is transferred to a 170 C rotary oven at a rate of 5 r/min for 24 h. The zeolite obtained by rotating was named as RBZ5(30, 50). In contrast, the BZ5(30, 50) represented the zeolite prepared with static crystallization.",

The basic properties of SL can be referenced from prior work (Zhao et al., 2023). Details regarding the catalyst preparation materials are provided in the Supplementary Information. <header>Catalyst preparation<text>The catalysts was synthesized according to the previously reported method (Fu et al., 2020). Al(NO3)3, TEOS, and TPAOH were employed as the Al, Si, and template sources, respectively, with a molar ratio of 60 SiO2: 1 Al2O3: 15 TPAOH: 5 Na2O: 500 H2O. The diagram of catalyst preparation is shown in Fig. 1 . Specifically, 36.2 g of TEOS was added to 35.3 g of TPAOH and stirred at 80 C for 2 h to prepare the synthesis gel. Successively, 2.2 g of Al(NO3)3 and 1.2 g of NaOH were dissolved in 25.1 g of deionized water, added dropwise to the gel, and stirred for 5.5 h. The resulting mixture underwent hydrothermal synthesis at 170 C for 24 h in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After synthesis, the samples were separated, washed with deionized water, dried at 100 C overnight, and calcinated for 6 h at 550 C to obtain Na-PHZ5 catalysts. The Na-PHZ5 was further modified by mixing TPAOH solutions of various concentrations (0.1\u20130.7 M) at a solid\u2013liquid ratio of 1:10 for 10 min, followed by heat treated at 170 C for 48 h in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The resulting product was collected, washed to neutral, and dried at 100 C overnight. The solid product obtained was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 C for 6 h. Similar treatment was applied to Na-PHZ5 by adding TPABr (0.1 and 0.2 M) to a 0.3 M TPAOH solution. All catalysts were ion-exchanged with 1 M NH4Cl (20 mL NH4Cl/1 g catalysts) at 80 C for 2 h repeated thrice, followed by drying and calcination at 550 C for 6 h. The resultant parent catalyst was labeled PHZ5, and those further treated with TPAOH (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M) were denoted HZ5-1T, HZ5-3T, HZ5-5T, and HZ5-7T, respectively. The catalysts co-hydrothermally treated with TPAOH (0.3 M) and TPABr (0.1 and 0.2 M) were named HZ5-3T1B and HZ5-3T2B.",

        "text": "In this work, sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, 98 wt%) and SiO2 gel (AS-40, 40 wt%) were used as the aluminum and silicon resources, respectively. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97 wt%) was the alkali source and hexamethonium bromide (HMBr2, 98 wt%) was the structure directing agent (SDA). Dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride solution (C26H58ClNO3Si, 40 wt% in methanol, containing (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane) was used as the organosilane reagent, labeled as TPOAC. Potassium bromide (KBr, 99 %) was used for FT-IR test. SiO2 gel was purchased from Shanghai Sigma-Aldrich Trading Co. Ltd. Sodium aluminate was supplied by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. Other chemical reagents were provided by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (China). All reagents were directly used without any further treatment. Distilled water was purchased from Watsons. <header>Zeolites synthesis<text>The molar composition of gel precursor for synthesizing parent EU-1 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 60, i.e., Si/Al = 30) was 8 Na2O : 1 Al2O3 : 60 SiO2 : 6 HMBr2 : 1765 H2O. The detailed procedure was described as follows: 2.7 g SiO2 gel was first dropped in 6.48 g distilled water at ambient temperature, which was then mixed homogeneously with stirring at 550 rpm and 60 C. The Na-type EU-1, with mass percentage of 0.2 % based on the weight of gel precursor, was used as the crystal seeds and added into the above mixture to shorten the crystallization time. This mixed solution was recorded as solution A. After precrystallization for 3 h, 0.049 g NaAlO2, 0.172 g NaOH and 0.651 g HMBr2 were dissolved in distilled water and mixed well, which was recorded as solution B. Then the solution B was dropped into solution A, and the mixture was continued to stir for another 3 h. Then the gel precursor was poured into a Teflon-sealed stainless-steel reactor for crystallization at 170 C for 72 h. Afterwards, the resulting solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times, finally dried at 100 C overnight. In order to reduce the crystal sizes of EU-1 zeolite, the organosilane reagent (with the amount of 0.15 g or 0.30 g, corresponding to 1.3 % or 2.6 % of the total mass of gel precursor) was slowly dropped into the solution A to functionalize the protozeolitic units. The other procedures followed the same for the synthesis of the parent zeolite. The solution A obtained under different synthesis conditions were abbreviated as 0\u201360 C-3 h-SA, 0.15\u201360 C-3 h-SA and 0.30\u201360 C-3 h-SA. The gel precursors comprised solution A and solution B were recorded as 0\u201360 C-6 h-G, 0.15\u201360 C-6 h-G and 0.30\u201360 C-6 h-G, respectively (0, 0.15 and 0.30 represented the addition amount of TPOAC). In order to study the variation of relative crystallinities and morphologies of zeolite samples prepared with different crystallization time, the gel precursors were hydrothermally treated for various time periods (24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively). The samples obtained with different crystallization time were labelled as 0-EU-1\u201324 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201336 h, 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h, etc. The SDA of these zeolite samples was not removed. The 0-EU-1\u201372 h, 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h and 0.30-EU-1\u201372 h zeolite samples were calcined at 550 C for 8 h to remove the organic template, and the suffix \u201ccal\u201d was included in the abbreviation to indicate the SDA of zeolite was removed by calcination (e.g., 0.15-EU-1\u201372 h-cal, Na-type zeolites). These Na-type zeolites were converted into NH4-type zeolites by ion exchanging with 1 M NH4Cl solution at 90 C for 2 h, and this process was repeated for three times. The white solid products were separated from the mixed solution by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for three times. The precipitates were dried in the oven at 80 C for 10 h and then calcined at 550 C for 5 h to obtain the H-type zeolites. The suffix \u201cH\u201d indicated that the zeolite sample was obtained by ion exchange (e.g., 0-EU-1-H). To study the interaction between TPOAC and Al species, the verified experiment was proceeded under the same conditions for synthesizing parent EU-1 zeolite. The gel precursors were obtained in the absence of SiO2 gel and crystal seeds in order to exclude the influence of silicon resource, with similar precrystallization and crystallization treatments.",

The ZSM-5 precursor solution was prepared in a molar ratio of 100 SiO2: 1 Al2O3: 1500 TEOS: 25 TPAOH: 5 APTES: 2500 H2O. The specific synthesis steps were as follows: Firstly, TPAOH, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate solution and TEOS were sequentially added to the flask and mixed homogeneously, the obtained solution was heated with constant stirring at 363 K for 12 h, and aged at room temperature for 12 h. Then, APTES was added to the flask and mixed homogeneously, and the solution was heated with constant stirring at 363 K for another 8 h to obtain the ZSM-5 precursor solution. The precursor solution was transferred into stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal crystallization at 443 K for 120 h. The obtained product was centrifugally washed and dried at 353 K for 12 h, and the original hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite could be obtained after calcination at 873 K for 8 h, which was marked HZ.<header>Chemical liquid deposition of SiO<text>First of all, original hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite about 2.0 g was added to the flask, and TEOS/n-hexane precursor solution was prepared according to the mass ratio of SiO2/ZSM-5 = 5 wt%. The precursor solution was added to the flask and uniformly mixed with the zeolite powder, and then heated with constant stirring at 333 K for 2 h. After centrifugal washing, the obtained product was dried at 353 K for 12 h, and calcined at 873 K for 6 h. As shown in Scheme 1 , the above operation was repeated (i.e., multiple chemical liquid depositions) to obtain SiO2 layers with specific thicknesses over hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, which were named HZ-X-CLD (X represents the number of SiO2 deposition cycles, X = 1, 3, 6). It was worth noting that TEOS has a molecular size of 10.3 \u00c5, which is much larger than the micropore size of ZSM-5 zeolite. Therefore, TEOS molecules are not able to enter the internal micropores of zeolite particles during chemical liquid deposition, only grafting on the hydroxyl group over external surface, thus ultimately the formation of SiO2 layer after high temperature calcination will not block the internal micropore structure of zeolite particles.",

Ultra-pure water is provided by the water plant of East China University of Science and Technology. Propane (C3H8, >99.5 vol%) and nitrogen (N2, >99.9 vol%) were provided by Shanghai Pujiang Special Gas Co., LTD. <header>Preparation methods<text>ZSM-5 zeolite with one-dimensional fins on the (010) plane was prepared by hydrothermal method using TPAOH and TMAOH as co-templates. In detail, required amounts of TEOS, Al(iso-pr)3, TPAOH and TMAOH were added into ultra-pure water and the mixture was stirred for 4 h till a clear sol was obtained. The sol with the composition of 1 TEOS: 1/30 Al(iso-pr)3: 0.34 TPAOH: 0.1 TMAOH: 30 H2O was then crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 170 C for 72 h under tumbling of 30 r/min and the white precipitates were recovered via centrifugation at 5000 r/min, after which the solid products were elevated to 550 C by 2 C/min and calcined for 6 h in a muffle furnace. The as-synthesized finned ZSM-5 samples were indexed as Z5-TMA, wherein TMA denotes to TMAOH. For comparison, conventional micron-sized ZSM-5 was synthesized by hydrothermal method with the precursor composition of 1 TEOS: 1/30 Al(iso-pr)3: 0.2 TPAOH: 0.1 NaOH: 40 H2O. In a typical batch, NaOH, TPAOH, and Al(iso-pr)3 were charged into ultra-pure water under vigorous stirring till the solution is clear; then TEOS is added and the mixture is stirred for another 3 h to fulfil a complete hydrolysis; in the following the white gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave to proceed static hydrothermal treatment at 170 C for 72 h; thereafter the crystallization was quenched by tapping water and the products were filtered till neutral and dried at 110 C overnight; finally the collected white powders were elevated to 550 C by 2 C/min and calcined for 6 h in a muffle furnace. The obtained Na-form ZSM-5 were exchanged in 1 M NH4Cl solutions and calcined again, and this exchange-calcination process was repeated twice to acquire the H-form ZSM-5 samples. Conventional ZSM-5 sample were labelled as Z5-Na, wherein Na indicates NaOH. Zn loaded ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method, briefly, Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and ultra-pure water of required amounts were mixed with 1 g Z5-Na or Z5-TMA, then the slurry was aged at ambient environment for 24 h and dried at 120 C for 12 h, the powders were subjected to calcination employing identical procedures with the above-mentioned ones. 2 wt% Zn loaded samples were named as Zn/Z5-Na or Zn/Z5-TMA according to the supports used. In special cases, H-form Z5-Na were added into the sol of Z5-TMA as seed before hydrothermal treatment. In the crystallization mechanism study, the amount of TMAOH or TPAOH may vary but the total concentration of OH\u2013 were kept constant (OH\u2013/Si/H2O = 0.44/1/30). These samples were named as xPyM wherein P denotes to TPAOH and M denotes to TMAOH, for example, the name 0.44P0M indicates a TPAOH/Si ratio of 0.44 is used with the absence of TMAOH. In the crystallization period study, the solid products were extracted by centrifugation from the autoclaves periodically.",

        "text": "<header>Preparation of alkali-modified ZSM-5<text>The zeolite used in this work was a commercial ZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 25.1 g of ZSM-5 underwent treatment with 20 mL of 1 mol/L NaOH aqueous solution for 6 h under stirring conditions. Following this, the mixture underwent suction filtration and was rinsed with ultrapure water until reaching a neutral pH. Subsequently, the alkali-treated ZSM-5 was transferred to a pristine beaker and underwent drying at 80 C for 24 h. The untreated sample is obtained as ZSM-5(P) and the samples treated with NaOH aqueous solutions are obtained as ZSM-5(AT). The alkaline modification method is relatively mild and produces less harmful substances.<header>Synthesis of chitin modified ZSM-5(AT) (chitin/ZSM-5(AT))<text>1 g of chitin powder was dispersed in a water-based solvent comprising 11 wt% NaOH and 4 wt% urea (50 g), and stirred evenly. Afterward, the mixture was frozen at -30 C in a cooling trap for 3 h and then thawed at 2 C. This freezing/thawing process was iterated three times to yield a transparent mixed chitin solution. 8 g of ZSM-5(AT) powder was then added to this solution and stirred for 30 min under continuous magnetic stirring to ensure that ZSM-5(AT) and chitin were completely and uniformly mixed. 60 mL of anhydrous ethanol was introduced into the mixed solution and left for 15 min. After the chitin and ZSM-5(AT) composite formed a colloid, the colloid was transferred to a clean beaker with 60 mL of anhydrous ethanol and immersed for 24 h. The colloid underwent suction filtration and was rinsed with ultrapure water until neutral and freeze-dried for 24 h for later use. This material obtained is expressed as \u201cChitin/ZSM-5(AT)\u201d. Chitin itself is a biodegradable green material. In addition, to avoid possible organic solvent residues and causing harm to the environment, a green solvent is chosen for dissolving chitin, which is more environmentally friendly compared with other organic solvents.<header>Synthesis of NZVI@Chitin-modified ZSM-5 (NZVI@C-ZSM) and NZVI@ZSM<text>In a 250 mL beaker, 3.72 g of FeSO4\u00b77H2O were dissolved in 45 mL of ultrapure water with stirring until completely dissolved. And then 0.5 g Chitin/ZSM-5(AT) was introduced into the mixture and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 30 mL of a 1.2 mol/L KBH4 solution was added dropwise, and let stand for 30 min. For immobilization of NZVI, Fe3+ ions are initially anchored onto the functional groups of chitin via adsorption. Fe3+ ions can interact with the N\u2013H or CO groups of the hydroxyl and acetamide groups in chitin, forming chelates (K. V. SandV., 2021). Subsequently, the anchored Fe3+ ions are in situ reduced by adding KBH4, forming NZVI on the chitin (Chen et al., 2023a). The entirety of the synthesis procedure was conducted without the need for N2 protection (Fig. 1 ). The synthesized material was isolated via suction filtration and underwent triple washing with ultrapure water and ethanol. This material obtained is designated as \u201cNZVI@C-ZSM\u201d. The composite material without surfactant chitin was prepared using the same method. All other steps were consistent with the preparation of NZVI@C-ZSM, except that 0.5 g of Chitin/ZSM-5(AT) was replaced with 0.5 g of ZSM-5(AT), and the resulting material was named NZVI@ZSM.",

        "text": "The sodium hydroxide (NaOH, purity > 99.99%), sodium silicate (Na2O\u00b7nSiO2, purity = 20%), sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, purity = 99%), aluminium sulfate octadecahydrate (Al2(SO4)3\u00b718H2O, purity = 99%) and carbon disulfide (CS2, purity = 99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin reagent Co., Ltd. (China). The activated carbon was purchased from Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin). The conventional NaZSM-5, conventional NaY, nanocrystal NaZSM-5, and NaSAPO-34 zeolites were purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd. (China). They were denoted as NaZSM-5, NaY, nano-NaZSM-5, and NaSAPO-34, respectively. <header>Preparations of alkali-treated zeolites and nano-crystal NaY zeolites<text>The alkali-treated NaZSM-5 or alkali-treated NaY samples were prepared by treating the conventional NaZSM-5 or conventional NaY in the NaOH solution at 353 K. Here, the weight ratio of zeolite to NaOH solution for alkaline treatment was 1.0/30.0 (wt./wt.). Then, the treated samples were filtrated and carefully washed with deionized water until the pH \u2248 7, and then dried in an oven at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 793 K for 2 h. The obtained samples were denoted as x-yAT-NaZSM-5 or x-yAT-NaY. Here, x was the hourage of alkaline-treatment time, and y was the concentration value of the NaOH solution used in alkaline treatment. AT means alkaline treatment. For example, 3-0.1AT-NaZSM-5 was the sample prepared by treating NaZSM-5 in a 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution for 3 h at 353 K. The nano-crystal NaY was synthesized as the following procedures. At first, the structure-directing agent with a molar composition of 13.8 Na2O: 1.0 Al2O3 : 10.8 SiO2 : 226.0 H2O (molar ratio), was prepared by firstly mixing the required amounts of NaAlO2, NaOH, sodium silicate (Na2O\u00b7nSiO2) and distilled water together, and subsequently ageing at 305 K for 16 h in an oven. Secondly, the gel for preparing nano-crystal NaY was prepared by mixing the required amounts of NaAlO2, NaOH, C2H5OH, Al2(SO4)3\u00b718H2O, sodium silicate, distilled water, and structure-directing agent together. Its molar composition was 6.5 Na2O : 1.0 Al2O3 : 10.1 SiO2 : 220 H2O: f C2H5OH (molar ratio). After stirring for 2 h, the obtained gel was transferred into a 0.5 L stainless steel autoclave and then hydrothermally treated at 353 K for 16 h. The obtained solid sample was filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water until pH \u2248 7, then dried at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 793 K for 2 h. This prepared nano-crystal NaY was denoted as nano-NaY-f. Here f was the molar ratio of C2H5OH to Al2O3 for the synthesis gel. For example, the nano-NaY-0.909 was the nano-crystal NaY synthesized by using a gel with a molar composition of 6.5 Na2O : 1.0 Al2O3 : 10.1 SiO2 : 220 H2O : 0.909 C2H5OH.",

The gel composition was: 100 SiO2: 1.2 Al2O3: 7.0 NaOH: 200 IPA: 30H2O. In a typical batch, 0.37 g NaOH was firstly dissolved in 56.00 g distilled water, followed by the addition of 0.40 g NaAlO2. The clear solution was vigorously stirred for 10 min, and 20.00 g colloidal silicate was dropwise charged to proceed another 4 h of stirring. Next, 15.66 g IPA as OSDA which has been previously dispersed in 16.00 g H2O, was dropped into the obtained white slurry. The obtained mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 160 C for 96 h under tumbling (30 rpm).

After the VPT treatment, the autoclave was cooled with tap water and the solid was washed with distilled water. After drying 12 h at 110 C, calcination at 550 C for 6 h was carried out to remove organic residuals. The ZSM-23 treated with pure water was named as ZW (ZSM-23 treated by water), while other samples treated with IPA solutions were labelled as Z50I or Z100I, denoting to ZSM-23 treated by IPA solutions of 50 M and 100 M, respectively.",

        "text": "<header>Catalyst preparation and characterization<text>HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Corp, China. Prior to the work, it was calcined in a tubular furnace at 550 C for 5 h to remove impurities and absorbed water. HZSM-5 was further modified with monometallic Co or bimetallic Mo-Co, Ni-Co via wet impregnation method. The modified HZSM-5 was denoted as Co-H-5, Mo/Co-H-5 and Ni/Co-H-5, respectively. Co-H-5 (Co loading: 3 wt%) was prepared by impregnating 24 g of HZSM-5 in an aqueous solution of 3.6 g of Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O. The mixture was vibrated in ultrasonic instrument for 2 h and impregnated overnight in vacuum dryer to enhance the dispersion of Co ions into the pore. It was then dried at 60 C for 4 h and 110 C for 5 h. Finally, the solid was calcined at 600 C for 6 h. The metal-Co loading was calculated via the mass ratio between metal-Co and HZSM-5 support. The bimetallic Mo-Co or Ni-Co catalysts were similarly prepared by impregnating Co-H-5 support. 16 g of Co-H-5 was divided into two parts and impregnated in 3.1 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O and 1.2 g of Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O hydrate solution, respectively. All bimetallic catalysts were based on 3 wt% of Co content [34]. For mesoporous HZSM-5, the support was slowly added into 0.2 M NaOH solution and stirred at 65 C for 1 h. It was then filtered and washed with distilled water until neutral. The filter cake was dried at 110 C for 24 h. The prepared Na-form ZSM-5 was ion-exchanged with 1 M NH4NO3 solution to prepare H-form HZSM-5 (AT-HZSM-5). Metal-loaded AT-HZSM-5 was also prepared via wet impregnation method. The Co, Mo-Co and Ni-Co modified AT-HZSM-5 was denoted as AT-Co/H-5, AT-Mo/Co-H-5 and AT-Ni/Co-H-5, respectively. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometric (ICP-AES), N2 adsorption-desorption instrument, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The corresponding specification and test program were demonstrated in the Supplementary Material.",

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), nitric acid (65 %), sodium bicarbonate (>99.7 %), sodium carbonate (>99.5 %), sodium hydroxide (>98 %), sodium sulphate (>99.0 %), and sulfuric acid (98 %) were purchased from Merck. Ammonia (99.99 %) and nitrogen (99.99 %) were supplied by SIAD and Alphagaz 1, respectively. Copper(II) nitrate hemipentahydrate (98 %) was purchased from Riedel de Haen. NaY (NaY CBV-100 Si/Al = 2.8) and NH4ZSM5 (CBV 3024E Si/Al = 15) zeolites in powder form were provided by Zeolyst International. <header>Preparation of hierarchical zeolites<text>The commercial NaY (Y_micr) and NH4ZSM5 (ZSM5_micr) zeolites were modified through a surfactant-mediated desilication treatment, optimised from a method reported in previous works, in order to obtain the hierarchical forms [30,31]. Prior to desilication, the zeolites were submitted to different pretreatments. Y_micr was acid-washed with a 10 wt% citric acid solution to fragilize the structure, using 2 mL of solution (i.e., ca. 1 mmol of citric acid) for 1 g of zeolite. After around 17 h under stirring at room temperature (RT), the solid was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight. In the case of ZSM5_micr, before desilication, the structure was fragilized in two consecutive steps: first the zeolite was dispersed in a NaOH solution (1 M, 4 mL per gram of zeolite), stirred for 1 h at 80 C and then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight; subsequently, the resulting powder was dispersed in a H2SO4 solution (0.6 M, 4 mL per gram of zeolite) for 3 h at 80 C, under stirring and finally recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at 110 C overnight. The pre-treated Y and ZSM5 zeolites were then used to prepare the hierarchical structures through the surfactant-mediated desilication process. Typically, a dispersion was prepared with the ratio of 64 mL of a NaOH solution (0.37 M) and 0.7 g of CTAB for each gram of zeolite. After stirring for 20 min at RT and adjusting the pH to 11 with a 2 M HCl solution, the dispersion (ca. 25 mL) was transferred into a 50 mL stainless steel PTFE-lined autoclave and heated at 150 C under autogenous pressure for 6 h. The obtained solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight at 110 C.<header>Preparation of metal-exchanged zeolites<text>For the preparation of the metal-exchanged zeolites, Ni and Cu ions were inserted into the porous structure of both parent (Y_micr and ZSM5_micr) and hierarchical zeolites (Y_hier and ZSM5_hier) via an ion-exchange procedure. In a typical procedure, 1 g of the starting zeolite was suspended in 50 mL of a solution containing both metal precursors (nitrates), each at a concentration equal to 0.001 M, and stirred at 300 rpm for 24 h at RT. The obtained solid was then recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried at 80 C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 350 C for 4 h.<header>Preparation of the modified electrodes<text>In order to test the metal-exchanged zeolites as electrocatalysts for GEOR, they were used for the preparation of the zeolite-modified electrodes. A Toray carbon paper with a surface of 2 \u00d7 4 cm2 was first glued to a platinum electrode with conductive carbon cement, and then dried for 24 h at RT. Next, 20 mg of the metal-exchanged zeolite were mixed in a Nafion/water solution (180 \u03bcL of Nafion and 180 \u03bcL of type-1) and the suspension was homogenised in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. Finally, the suspension was deposited on the Toray carbon paper and dried for 24 h at RT.",

The parent zeolite was a commercial Y zeolite (CBV 760, Zeolyst International, protonic form). The modified sample was the result of the following alkaline treatment on the parent zeolite [14,27\u201329]. 10 g of zeolite were suspended in 300 mL of a NaOH solution (0.10 M) and the suspension was stirred during 15 min at room temperature. Then, a 1.00 M HCl solution was added to the suspension to reach a final pH of 2.00 in order to quench the alkaline leaching. The thus desilicated zeolite was separated from the solution by filtration and submitted to three cycles of ion exchange using 5 mL of 0.50 M NH4Cl solution per gram of zeolite. The ion-exchanged zeolite was then thoroughly washed using deionized water, dried in an oven during 16 h at 110 C and finally calcined in a muffle oven during 4 h at 550 C in order to obtain the zeolite in its acid form. The parent and desilicated zeolites were named Y-00 and Y-10, respectively. Both the modified and untreated zeolites were hydrothermally stabilized by steaming during 5 h at 788 C (100% steam). The steamed zeolites were named Y-00-S and Y-10-S, respectively, in concordance with their parent zeolites.",

Before use, the parent Na-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (coded as \u201cparent\u201d) was converted to the ammonium form of zeolite (NH4-ZSM-5) by three consecutive ion exchange steps using 2.0 M NH4NO3 solution ( 1 g Z e o l i t e 20 m l N H 4 N O 3 ) for 3 h at 75 C. The powder was then calcined for 4 h at 550 C to obtain the H-form zeolite (H-ZSM-5). The M/ZSM-5 catalysts (M: Fe, Ga, Zr, Ce, and La) were synthesized by treating the parent with NH4HF2/metal solution. The experiment is described using Fe metal as an example. A mixture with a 2:3 M ratio of Fe(NO3)3: NH4HF2 and Fe/Al ratio of 1 was dispersed in 250 ml of deionized water and the dispersion obtained was then added to a known amount of the parent powder. After stirring for 10 min, a uniform solution was obtained, which was refluxed for 24 h at 90 C at 240 rpm under the lab hood. After cooling the mixture at ambient temperature, the solid was filtered, washed thoroughly with hot deionized water, and dried at 100 C for 4 h. Finally, the sample was calcined at 600 C for 4 h. This catalyst was coded as Fe\u2013F-Z, based on the metal name-F-Z (Metal-F-Z).",

The catalyst was pulverized followed by calcination at 550 C for 5 h in muffle furnace to remove the template agent. According to the Fig. 1 , the H5 was modified through two steps. Firstly, the H5 was treated by 0.2 mol/L NaOH solution for 30 min in water bath at 60 C. Subsequently, the catalyst was filtered and washed with distilled water until it was neutralized. Then it was dried at 110 C for 24 h. In order to obtain the H-form zeolite, the Na-form zeolite was adopted ion exchanged with 1 mol/L NH4Cl solution. The treated H5 was named AT0.2/H5. Secondly, the zirconium nitrate pentahydrate was dissolve in 50 mL distilled water. Then the AT0.2/H5 was added to the zirconium nitrate pentahydrate solution. The mixture was ultrasonic for 3 h and then dried at 80 C for 24 h. The dried solid was calcined at 300 C for 3 h. The obtained sample was mixed with different concentrations of sulfuric acid following by drying at 110 C for 12 h, and then calcining at 600 C for 5 h. The solid acid catalyst was obtained and denoted as AT0.2/SZxH5, where x represents the molar ratio of S/Zr (S: sulfuric acid and Zr:ZrO2), that is, x = 2:1, 4:1, 6:1 and 8:1. All the catalysts were stored in dry environment to avoid water adsorption. The prepared catalysts were characterized using several analytical tools such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption\u2013desorption, NH3-Temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The test procedure of instruments were also reported in literature [17,23\u201325].",

        "text": "<header>Materials preparation<text>A commercial H-ZSM-5 sample (Grace Davison; Si/Al = 17) was used as a parent material to prepare hierarchical materials. Prior to treatment, the parent zeolite was brought into the ammonium form by three successive ion exchanges at 333 K for 6 h with 1 M NH4Cl aqueous solution (20g of solution/g of zeolite). In the first set of experiments, the concentration of NH4F solution was kept constant, and the amount of NH4-ZSM-5 was varied. In contrast, in the second set of experiments the concentration of the NH4F solution was varied, keeping the concentration of zeolite constant. Thus, not only the NH4F concentration but also the solid:liquid (zeolite:solution) ratio was varied. The first set of experiments has been performed as follows: 8 g of NH4F (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) has been dissolved in 12 g of distilled water under mechanical stirring (400 rpm) at 323 K. Then, between 1 and 4 g of NH4-ZSM-5 was introduced into the solution and let under mechanical stirring (400 rpm) for 2 h at 323 K (the following table - <R><C>[EMPTY]<C>First set of experiments<C>First set of experiments<C>First set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<R><C>m(NH4<C>1<C>2<C>4<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<R><C>m(NH4<C>8<C>8<C>8<C>8<C>6<C>4<C>2<C>1<C>0.5<C>0.25<R><C>m(water) (g)<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<R><C>NH4<C>40<C>40<C>40<C>40.0<C>33.3<C>25.0<C>14.3<C>7.7<C>4.0<C>2.0<Cap>Amount of ZSM-5, NH44</Cap> ).

In the second set of experiments, between 8 and 0.25 g of NH4F (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 12 g of distilled water under mechanical stirring (400 rpm) at 323 K.

Intermediate samples were taken out after 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 h of reaction. The resulting materials have been thoroughly washed with distilled water and dried at 373 K overnight. The samples were denoted NH4F(X)-ZSM-5(Y)-Z, where X and Y respectively stand for the weight of NH4F and NH4-ZSM-5 in gram per 12 g of water, and Z is the reaction time in hours. The maximum yield of modified zeolite (%Ymax) has been calculated from the total amount of material collected as follow: % Y max = \u2211 m t m i n i \u00d7 100 where mt is the weight of zeolite taken for different treatment times and mini is the initial weight of zeolite.<header>Study of the influence of the weight concentration of zeolite<text>In the first part of the study, from 1 to 4 g of zeolite was treated in 20 g of a 40 wt% NH4F solution (see the following table - <R><C>[EMPTY]<C>First set of experiments<C>First set of experiments<C>First set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<C>Second set of experiments<R><C>m(NH4<C>1<C>2<C>4<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<C>1<R><C>m(NH4<C>8<C>8<C>8<C>8<C>6<C>4<C>2<C>1<C>0.5<C>0.25<R><C>m(water) (g)<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<C>12<R><C>NH4<C>40<C>40<C>40<C>40.0<C>33.3<C>25.0<C>14.3<C>7.7<C>4.0<C>2.0<Cap>Amount of ZSM-5, NH44</Cap> for more details).",

Desilication was carried out by mixing 7.5 g HZSM-5 with 150 mL of 0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution at 80 C for 2 h under vigorously stirring condition. Afterwards, the cooled suspension was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water until pH reached to 7, and dried at 100 C overnight. The desilicated Na-ZSM-5 zeolite was transferred into H-form ZSM-5 by three consecutive conventional ion exchanges with 0.8 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 C for under stirring condition 8 h and calcined at 550 C for 4 h under the flow of synthetic air. Dealumination by steaming was performed in a fixed bed reactor. The catalyst (ca. 1.6 g) was charged into a quartz tube. After that, steaming treatment was conducted at 450 C under a flow of pure water vapours (WHSV = 12 h-1) for 3 h. Here, the separate treated HZSM-5 zeolites were labeled as 0.3 M NaOH/HZSM-5 and 3 h 450 C/HZSM-5, and the co-modified zeolite samples were denoted as 0.3 M NaOH/3h 450 C/HZSM-5 and 3 h 450 C/0.3 M NaOH/HZSM-5 according to the sequential order of desilication and steaming treatment, respectively.",

An appropriate amount of TEOS was added dropwise to 1.0 M TPAOH solution, and then fully stirred at 35\u2103 for 2 h to form a well-mixed solution. Hydrolyzed AIP in deionized water was then slowly added to the solution. The molar ratio of the gel mixture was 1 TEOS: 0.025 AIP: 0.21 TPAOH: 36 H2O. The mixture was heated and stirred at 85\u2103 for 3 h to remove alcohol, during which time deionized water was continuously added to maintain the original water level. After that, the alcohol-free mixture was transferred into a hydrothermal crystallization kettle to be crystallized for 72 h at 170 \u2103. The crystallized product was separated by a centrifuge and then washed with deionized water to reach a neutral pH. The obtained solid was dried at 100 \u2103, and then calcined at 550 \u2103 for 6 h in a muffle to obtain the parent HZSM-5 zeolite.<header>Preparation of hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolites<text>Hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by NaOH leaching. Three NaOH solutions with different concentrations (0.1 M, 0.3 M and 0.5 M) were prepared to create hierarchical structures in HZSM-5 crystals. The parent HZSM-5 zeolite was added into NaOH solution at a ratio of 1 g HZSM-5 zeolite to 10 ml NaOH solution. The mixture of HZSM-5 zeolite and NaOH solution was stirred at 80 \u2103 for 2 h. After that, the zeolite was separated by a centrifuge, washed to neutrality using deionized water, and then dried at 80 \u2103 for 8 h. The dried zeolite was added into a 1.0 M NH4Cl solution at a ratio of 1 g zeolite to 10 ml NH4Cl solution, and then stirred at 80 \u2103 for 2 h. The solid was separated by a centrifuge and washed 3 times with deionized water. The washed sample was calcined at 550 \u2103 in a muffle for 6 h. The post-treated HZSM-5 zeolites were named as 0.1NaOHZ5, 0.3NaOHZ5 and 0.5NAOHZ5 according to the concentration of NaOH solution, respectively.",

A 200-\u03bcm thickness of 15 wt% PAN/NMP solution was cast onto a polyester nonwoven using casting knife. Then, the as-casting membrane was immersed immediately into a water coagulation bath for phase-inversion process. The modified PAN (mPAN) support was fabricated through hydrolysis of the PAN support by immersing into 2 M NaOH solution at 50 C for 30 min. Some \u2013CN groups of the PAN support was converted to \u2013COOH and \u2013CONH2 groups after the hydrolysis. Prior interfacial polymerization, mPAN support was washed by water for several hours [48]. Wet mPAN support was immersed in a 0.5 wt% aqueous DETA solution at room temperature for 1 min. The droplets of aqueous DETA solution that remained on the surface of the mPAN membrane was removed using rubber roller. Then, 0.5 wt% TMC/n-hexane solution was poured on the membrane at room temperature for 1 min. Polyamide layer was formed on top of the mPAN support. This membrane was immersed in methanol for several hours. Afterwards, it was dried at room temperature. This membrane was represented as TFC membranes. Similar methods to prepare TFN membranes with the TFC membranes. For TFN membranes, different types of nanozeolite were added in the TMC/n-hexane solution.

        "text": "<header>Catalyst preparation<text>This study obtained parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 177) from SINOPEC Catalyst Co., Ltd., and named as sample ZSM-5. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium aluminate (NaAlO2), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. During the representative alkaline treatment, the alkaline solution (100 ml) of a specific concentration was placed within a reflux condenser-equipped flask under 60 C on the water bath. Later, parent sample (10 g) was put in the above solution, followed by 4 h of stirring under a constant temperature. The slurry was then cooled down on the ice-bath, followed by filtration to separate the solid from the solution. Then, distilled water was used to rinse the solid till the filtrate pH was 7. NH4Cl solutions (1.0 M) were utilized for ion-exchange with all the sodium type alkaline treated ZSM-5 samples twice under 90 C, for the sake of replacing Na+ with NH4 +. At last, those zeolites modified were further filtered, rinsed according to previous description and dried for a 4-h period under 120 C. Typically, HZSM-5 zeolites were named exposed to 0.5 M NaOH, K2CO3, Na2CO3 and NaAlO2 as samples ZNaOH, ZK2CO3, ZNa2CO3, and ZNaAlO2, separately, whereas samples treated with 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 M NaHCO3 solutions as samples ZNaHCO3-0.2, ZNaHCO3, ZNaHCO3-1.0 and ZNaHCO3-2.0, respectively.",

Briefly, solution A was prepared by dissolving NaOH (99%, Merck) and sodium aluminate (53.0% Al2O3, 42.5% Na2O, Sigma-Aldrich). Solution B was prepared by mixing sodium silicate (26.5% SiO2, 10% Na2O, Sigma-Aldrich) with NaOH and distilled water. Solution A was added dropwise to solution B under vigorous stirring in ice bath for 30 min. After that, the TPOAC solution was added dropwise. The resulting gel solution was stirred for another 1 h before static aging at 25 C for 2 days, followed by crystallization at 80 C for 22 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the solid was washed repeatedly with distilled water via centrifugation (10000 rpm, 30 min) until pH 7 before drying at 70 C overnight. After that, the samples were calcined at 550 C for 6 h, heating rate of 1 C/min. The synthesized catalysts were donated as MYx, where \u00d7 represent the molar ratio of TPOAC (0.05, 0.15 and 0.25).

[33]. The KOH and Al2(SO4)3\u00b718H2O were mixed and dissolved in deionized water first, then DAH and silica sol were dropped into the mechanical agitator and stirred vigorously to obtain the precursor gel with mole ratios of SiO2: Al2O3: DAH: OH-: H2O = 1.0: 0.011: 0.4: 0.25: 35.0. The obtained precursor gel was moved into a Teflon autoclave, followed by dynamic crystallization at 160 C and 90 r/min for 34 h. After crystallization, the samples were centrifuged (three times) and dried (110 C) after being cooled to room temperature, followed by calcination at 600 C for 10 h to remove the DAH template. After that, the ZSM-22 sample and 1 M NH4NO3 solution were packed into a three-necked flask and ion-exchanged for 8 h at 80 C to obtain the acid ZSM-22 zeolite, which was denoted as the Z22-D sample. The hierarchical ZSM-22 zeolites were synthesized with almost the same process as that of the Z22-D sample, except that PHMB was employed as the only template instead of DAH and the addition amount of PHMB was SiO2/xPHMB, in which x = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.003. The obtained hierarchical ZSM-22 samples were named Z22-xP when x = 0.001, 0.002 and 0.003. The Pd/ZSM-22 bifunctional catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pd loading were prepared on the corresponding ZSM-22 samples via wetness impregnation with Pd(NO3)2 solution followed by drying overnight and calcination at 600 C in air for 4 h. All catalysts were pressed into flakes with a tableting machine for 3 min. Then, the flake samples were crushed into 20\u201340 mesh particles and then named Pd/Z22-D and Pd/Z22-xP, respectively.",

        "text": "The chemical materials used in this work were tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), aluminum isopropoxide (C9H21O3Al, 98%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99%), tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr, 98%), sulphuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 99%), trimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB, 97%), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 40 wt%), n-Pentane (C5H12, 99.99%). All the reagents were used as received without further purification. <header>Catalyst preparation<text>Na-ZSM-5 was synthesized based on the procedure reported by Yaripour et al. [32]. In a typical procedure, TPABr was dissolved in 13 ml deionized water in a beaker, and then 5 g TEOS was added to the solution and stirred for 60 min at room temperature (solution A). Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.213 g aluminum isopropoxide in 13.5 ml of water. After 30 min of stirring, 0.208 g NaOH was added to the solution and stirred for another 30 min. Solution B was added dropwise to solution A. The molar composition of the prepared material was 1SiO2:0.04Al2O4:0.16Na:83H2O. The pH of the final solution was set to 10 by adding H2SO4 (2 M) during the stirring process. The solution was put into a 150 ml Teflon-lined autoclave at 175 C. After 72 h, the autoclave was quenched in cold water, and the obtained sample was filtered and washed three times with deionized water and dried in an oven at 110 C overnight. The obtained solid was calcined at 550 C (3 C/min) for five h to remove impurities. Desilication was done by introducing 1 g of Na-ZSM-5 to 20 ml NaOH solution (0.2 or 0.5 M) while stirring at 65 C for one h. After that, the suspension was filtered and washed three times with deionized water, and then the wet cake was dried at 110 C overnight. To synthesize MCM-41/ZSM-5 samples, 1 g of Na-ZSM-5 was dispersed in 10 ml NaOH (0.5 M) solution and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Another solution containing X wt.% CTAB in 20 ml deionized water was prepared, and then the solution containing CTAB was added dropwise to the first solution, and the prepared solution was stirred for 60 min. The obtained solution was transferred into a stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave at 110 C. After 24 h, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, and H2SO4 solution (2 M) was added to the mixture to adjust the desired pH value. The autoclave was sealed again and remained in the oven for another 24 h at 110 C. The solid products were filtered, washed three times, and dried overnight at 110 C. To remove organic templates, the samples were calcined in an air atmosphere for five h at 550 C to remove organic templates. Na-type samples were transformed to H-form by ion exchange with 1 mol/L NH4Cl solution at 80 C for two h. The ion-exchanged samples were filtered and washed with deionized water to remove chloride ions. This procedure was repeated two times, and the samples were dried at 110 C overnight. Platinum was loaded on the as-dried samples via impregnation method using H2PtCl6 solution to achieve 0.3 wt% Pt. The impregnated samples were dried at 110 C and calcined at 450 C for 4 h (3 C/min).

        "text": "<header>Preparation of samples<text>ZSM-48 zeolite was synthesized by seed-assistance route according to our previous work [36,37]. The detailed synthesis procedure was displayed in the Supplementary Material . Typically, the initial gel with the composition of 1.2 HMBr2: 60 SiO2: 0.75 Al2O3: 3.95 Na2O: 1200 H2O: 0.20 wt% crystal seed was hydrothermally crystallized for 24 h at 180 C. After filtration and calcination, the pristine zeolite ZSM-48 was subjected to consecutively multi-step leaching post-treatment procedures, including alkaline-acid, acid-alkaline-acid, H2O steaming-alkaline-acid, and NH4F-alkaline-acid, denoted as ZSM-48(A), ZSM-48(B), ZSM-48(H), and ZSM-48(F), respectively. The description scheme of post-treatment leaching procedures was exhibited in Fig. 1 . For Series I, ZSM-48 was firstly suffered from alkaline-treatment for desilication in 0.2 M NaOH solution at 80 C for 2 h (1 g/30 ml). After drying at 80 C for 8 h and sequential dealumination was performed in 0.1 M HNO3 at 60 C for 0.5 h (1 g/30 ml). For acid-alkaline-acid, steaming-alkaline-acid, and fluorination-alkaline-acid leaching routes, the pristine ZSM-48 was firstly subjected to (1) dealumination in 1 M HNO3 at 80 C for 1 h (1 g/30 ml); (2) H2O steaming treatment at 550 C for 2 h with water vapor WHSV of 2.4 h-1; (3) fluorination in 0.3 M NH4F solution at 30 C for 10 h (1 g/10 ml), respectively. Then the subsequent mild desilication in 0.2 M NaOH solution at 80 C for 0.5 h and mild dealumination in 0.1 M HNO3 solution at 60 C for 0.5 h was performed successively (1 g/30 ml). The obtained powder was filtrated, washed, dried, and calcined at 550 C for 5 h, prior to three sequential ammonium exchanges in 0.5 M NH4NO3 at 80 C (1 g/30 ml). After calcination at 550 C for 5 h, H-form zeolites was impregnated in H2PtCl6 solution for 0.5 wt% Pt metal loading, and then Pt-impregnated catalysts was calcined at 400 C for 3 h under a mixed flow (O2/Ar, 40/40 ml/min) with a heating rate of 2 C/min. Pt-supported catalysts were activated at 400 C for 3 h under pure H2 flow (40 ml/min) with a heating rate of 2 C/min before reaction.",

[19]. The reagents were mixed in stoichiometric proportions to obtain a gel with the following molar composition: 3 Na2O: 1 Al2O3: 20 SiO2: 400 H2O: Y NH4FER: X Luviquat, where Y = 10%, and X = 20%, 40%, or 60% relative to the total mass of silica. The reaction mixture was prepared through the following steps: (i) dissolution of sodium aluminate in one-third of the total water required for the synthesis (Solution I), (ii) dilution of sodium hydroxide in one-third of the water (Solution II), (iii) mix Solution I and II, then add the colloidal silica under stirring at 200 rpm at 50 C for 1 h (Solution III), (iv) gradually add the suspension of NH4FER seed crystals (previously dispersed in one-third of the water) in Solution III until complete homogenization, (v) add the Luviquat polymer to the remaining solution, maintaining the same agitation conditions, temperature, and time as in step (iii). The obtained synthesis gel was subsequently dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h and then crushed in a stainless-steel analytical knife mill. The dried and ground gel was carefully placed in an open Teflon vessel attached to a support (Fig. 1 (a)). This container was then inserted into a hermetically sealed Teflon vessel, which contained at the bottom 2 g of an EDA solution in distilled water mixed at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) for every 1 g of dry gel, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The set was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave (Fig. 1(c)) and heated in an oven at 160 C for 24 h. A polymer-free sample was synthesized under the same conditions to serve as a reference (denoted as an FP sample). After the synthesis period, the resulting solid was recovered by vacuum filtration, washed with distilled water until reaching approximately neutral pH, and then dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h. Subsequently, the samples were calcined from room temperature to 550 C for 6 h, under the heating rate of 2 C\u00b7min-1 and airflow of 100 mL min-1. The acidic FER zeolites were obtained by ion exchange using a 0.10 M ammonium nitrate solution, with a proportion of 1 g of sample for each 50 mL of solution, under stirring at 200 rpm for 2 h at 65 C. This process was repeated three times to ensure a high degree of ionic exchange, replacing Na + cations with NH4+ cations. After the exchange, the samples were recovered by filtration, washed, dried, and calcined under the previously described conditions (designated as FL20, FL40, and FL60 samples).<header>Post-synthesis treatment<text>The alkaline treatment of the calcined zeolites was carried out in a 300 mL Parr 4560 reactor using a solution of 0.20 M sodium hydroxide under stirring at 200 rpm at 80 C for 6 h. For all experiments, a proportion of 3.3 g of zeolite was used per 100 mL of alkaline solution [31]. After the treatment period, the solid was recovered by centrifugation, washed until reaching an approximately neutral pH, and then dried in an oven at 80 C for 12 h. The material obtained was subjected to ion exchange and calcined again under the same conditions described above (denoted as FPD, FL20D, FL40D, and FL60D samples).",

        "text": "<header>Synthesis and characterization of the hierarchical HZSM-5 by alkali treatment<text>The HZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio = 25) was obtained from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd. in China. The hierarchical HZSM-5 was prepared by the desilication approach using NaOH solution according to the previous literature reports [42,43]. First, calcination of the HZSM-5 was performed in muffle furnace at 550 C for 6 h to obtain the protonic form of ZSM-5. Then, the calcined zeolite was treated by the NaOH solutions with varying concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M. In this step, 5 g of calcined ZSM-5 was added into 150 mL NaOH solution, and stirred at 65 C for 30 min. After that, the desilication treated ZSM-5 was washed by deionized water to neutral. At last, the desilication treated ZSM-5 was ion exchanged in aqueous 1.0 M NH4NO3 solution at 50 C for 2 h, and then dried and calcined again to obtain acidic H-form of hierarchical HZSM-5. The HZSM-5 pretreated by varying concentrations of NaOH solution was named as Z-0.1 M, Z-0.3 M, Z-0.5 M, and Z-0.7 M, respectively. The textural properties, acidity, and morphology of the raw and pretreated HZSM-5 was tested by gas sorption analyzer, NH3-TPD, and SEM/TEM. Detailed experimental process of these four analytical instruments could be observed in our previous publications [9,10].",

Commercial ZSM-5 (CZ) zeolite was received from Nankai University Catalyst Plant. A Milli-Q water (18.2 M\u03a9\u00b7cm) was employed in all the experiments. <header>Catalysts synthesis<text>Hollow silicalite-1 (HS) and hollow ZSM-5 (HZ) zeolites were prepared by utilizing a post alkali treatment method [39,40]. Usually, 22.5 g of TEOS, 34.8 g of TPAOH and 49.0 g of H2O were blended in a flask and then stirred at 35 C overnight. Next, the mixture with a molar composition of 1 SiO2: 0.4 TPAOH: 35 H2O: 4 EtOH was transferred to a 150 mL of Teflon-lined steel autoclave and held at 170 C in a stove for 72 h. Subsequently, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed with H2O, dried at 120 C overnight, and roasted at 550 C for 8 h in a muffle. The sample obtained was marked as S-1. For the synthesis of HZ, 4.5 g of S-1 and 1.4 g of Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O were dispersed in a 90 mL of TPAOH solution (0.5 M), and heated to 170 C for 24 h. After cooled to room temperature, the sample was isolated by centrifuge, washed with H2O, dried at 120 C overnight, and calcined at 550 C for 8 h in a muffle. The ultimate product was denoted as HZ zeolite. In addition, to emphasize the effect of acidity in HZ zeolite for deep hydrogenation of aromatics, the HS was also prepared by the same procedure of HZ with no addition of the Al source. Highly dispersed platinum clusters anchored on various zeolites were fabricated by means of the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) strategy [36]. In a typical run, the desired amount of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 was dissolved in 200 mL of water, then the pH was adjusted to 11.5 with NH3\u00b7H2O solution. And the zeolite support was introduced under agitating intensely. Meanwhile, the amount of added zeolite was restricted to furnish a surface loading of 5000 m2/L and the metal loading of Pt was limited to 1.0 wt%. After stirred for 2 h, the solid powders were collected by centrifugalization, dried at 80 C overnight under vacuum conditions, and calcined at 450 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 1.0 C\u00b7min-1 in static air. The resulting products were labeled as Pt/HS-SEA, Pt/HZ-SEA and Pt/CZ-SEA, respectively. For comparison, wetness impregnation (WI) method was also utilized to prepare Pt catalysts. The zeolite was immersed in a aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2. Subsequently, the superfluous solvent was evaporated at 60 C in water bath. Then, the sample was further dried in an oven overnight, followed by calcination at 450 C for 4 h. Finally, the obtained catalysts were denoted as Pt/CZ-WI and Pt/HZ-WI, respectively.",

        "text": "<header>Synthesis<text>The ZSM-22 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized following a previously reported method using 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd.) as the organic structure directing agent (OSDA) [29]. Briefly, the precursor solution with a molar composition of Al2O3: 80SiO2: 6K2O: 17.5DAH:2025 H2O was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor and crystallized at 160 C for 48 h under autogenous pressure. Finally, the solid product was filtered, dried and calcined in air conditions at 560 C for 8 h. Calcined sample (denoted as KZ22) was repeatedly exchanged with the aqueous solution of NH4Cl at 80 C (3 \u00d7 3 h, 50 mL of a solution per 1 g of zeolite), washed with deionized water, dried at 120 C for 12 h. The ion-exchanged sample was labeled as NZ22. Then, the protonated zeolite ZSM-22 (Z22) was derived by calcining zeolite NZ22 as obtained at 450 C for 4 h without any further post-treatments. The controllable desilication treatment was carried out by introducing the NZ22 sample in the aqueous solution consisting cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., ltd.) and NaOH solution of different concentrations at 80 C for 10 h. After this procedure, the resulting solid was washed using deionized water until pH neutral and dried at 60 C for 24 h. Then, the samples were treated in an aqueous solution of 0.1 HCl at 80 C for 2 h. The Na ions were entirely removed from the solid products by exchanging with 0.5 M NH4Cl for 3 times. Finally, the samples were dried overnight and calcined in a furnace at 550 C for 4 h. The protonic samples were denoted as CZ22-015, CZ22-03, and CZ22-045, according to the NaOH concentrations (0.15 M, 0.3 M, and 0.45 M) in the desilication solution. For comparison, the NZ-22 sample was treated in the NaOH aqueous solution (0.3 M) at 80 C for 2 h without the addition of CTAB. The post-treatments consisting of the HCl wash, NH4Cl exchange, dryness and calcination followed the procedures of CZ22-x samples. The resulting solid product was labeled as DZ22-03.",

        "text": "<header>Catalysts preparation and characterization<text>Three PtPd catalysts supported on Y zeolite have been used. The zeolite (ultrastable CBV712) has been supplied by Zeolyst International in the ammonium form with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 12. The first catalyst (Cat-A) has been prepared using the zeolite without being submitted to any desilication treatment. The second one (Cat-B), has been prepared after submitting the zeolite to a desilication treatment (detailed below), whereas the third one (Cat-C) has been prepared after submitting twice the zeolite to the desilication treatment. The alkaline treatment method followed for zeolite desilication has consisted on [31]: i) suspension of 10 g in 300 mL of 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution and stirring for 15 min at room temperature; ii) neutralization of the suspension with an equivalent amount of 1.0 M HCl solution to quench the desilication treatment. No longer contact times are required since using an aqueous NaOH solution, most of the mesoporosity is developed in the first 15 min [41,42]; iii) the desilicated zeolite was filtered and washed with deionized water; iv) the zeolite was subjected to two subsequent ion exchange cycles of 24 h with a 0.50 M aqueous solution of NH4Cl at room temperature (zeolite/solution ratio of 1 g/5 mL), in order to ensure that the Na introduced during the leaching stage is totally removed. Lastly, v) the zeolite was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried in an oven at 110 C for 16 h, and calcined in a muffle at 550 C, using a heating ramp of 12 C min-1, and maintaining that temperature for 4 h. In all the cases, the incorporation of the metals (1 wt% of Pt and 0.5 wt% of Pd) has been carried out following the procedure described by Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [43]. The behavior of PtPd as a metal function to activate hydrogenation reactions is well established [44]. This bimetallic function offers advantages over each of the individual metals in terms of stability and higher conversion, due to its lower S retention. Moreover, the PtPd catalyst supported on HY zeolite is very stable and has an outstanding capacity for obtaining naphtha and medium distillates [43\u201345]. The catalysts have been extensively characterized in order to correlate their physicochemical properties with their catalytic behavior. In this way, the textural properties have been determined from the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. The crystalline structure of the supports has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The acidic properties have been measured by temperature-programmed desorption/cracking of tert-butylamine and by pyridine FTIR analysis. The composition of the catalysts and the metal content have been measured by wavelength dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, some TEM images have been acquired for characterizing in a higher extent the structure of the catalyst and for observing the metal dispersion. Finally, the coke deposited on the catalysts has been measured by temperature-programmed oxidation.

        "text": "<header>Primary synthesis of Nanosized zeolite Beta<text>The synthesis of zeolite beta was conducted using the methodology outlined in the pertinent literature [16]. In this study, the silica source used was fumed silica (Degussa, Aerosil 200), whereas the aluminum source employed was aluminum powder. Additionally, tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) (Aldrich, 35% aqueous solution) was utilized as the template agent. The precursor gel was composed of oxides with the following molar ratio: 30TEAOH: 50SiO2:Al2O3:750H2O. Aluminum metal was dissolved in a TEAOH-containing aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a transparent solution. Subsequently, this solution was introduced into a slurry composed of fumed silica and another portion of the TEAOH-containing aqueous solution. The aluminosilicate fluid gel that was created was agitated in a beaker at room temperature for 4 h. Following, it was placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave. The process of crystallization was conducted at a temperature of 140 C in a rotational state at a speed of 60 rpm for 3 days. The autoclave was subjected to quenching to stop the crystallization reaction. The separation of the finished product from the liquid was achieved by using a centrifuge operating at a speed of 16,000 rpm. Subsequently, the separated product underwent a washing process using deionized water until the pH level reached a value lower than 9.0. Finally, the product was subjected to a drying procedure in an oven at a temperature of 110 C. The resultant solid sample was named as NB-NC (nano-beta non-calcinated) in which the TEAOH template was not burned off.<header>Hierarchical nanosized beta synthesis<text>Mesoporous nanosized beta zeolites were synthesized by employing two main strategies consisting of hydrothermal treatment (steaming) and base treatment methods for non-calcined (NB-NC) and calcined (NB-C) nanosized beta zeolites. In the hydrothermal treatment method, the NB-NC (with TEAOH in the zeolite pores) or its calcinated counterpart (NB-C) samples were steamed using an autoclave reactor at temperature of 550 C for one hour and the pressure was maintained at 0.1 MPa throughout the treatment time by adjusting the pressure relief valve. Subsequently, the recovered steamed solids were calcined at 600 C for 4 h to remove the organic agents and the resultant products were named as NB-NC-HT-C and NB-C-HT-C respectively. In the base treatment method, two kind of experiments were carried out as follow: 1) a mixture of 0.5 M ammonia and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was mixed with NB-C or NB-NC, 2) only 0.5 M ammonia was mixed with NB-C or NB-NC. The two experiments were conducted by using PTFE lined 140 ml autoclave, and heated in the oven at 150 C for 10 h. Then, the autoclave was quenched and the final solid product was separated from the liquid using a 12,000 rpm centrifugation. The recovered solid was washed several times with distilled water, dried at 110 C, and subsequently, calcined at 600 C for 4 h to remove the organic agents. The resultant samples were named as NB-NC-BT and NB-NC-BT-wCTAB respectively. The synthesis conditions and samples names are summarized in Fig. 1 and the following table - <R><C>ParentBeta<C>NB-NCNanosized (non-calcined)<C>NB-NCNanosized (non-calcined)<C>NB-CNanosized (calcined)<C>NB-CNanosized (calcined)<R><C>[EMPTY]<C>Steam treated<C>Base treated<C>Steam treated<C>Base treated<R><C>ModifiedSamples<C>NB-NC-HT<C>NB-NC-BT<C>NB-C-HT<C>NB-C-BT<R><C>[EMPTY]<C>NB-NC-HT-C<C>NB-NC-BT-wCTAB<C>NB-C-HT-C<C>NB-C-BT-wCTAB<Cap>Summary of samples and synthesis conditions.</Cap> . The main parameters for base treatment were as follow: ammonia to zeolite ratio was 16.7 (ml/g), and CTAB to zeolite weight ratio was 0.3 (g/g).<header>Hydrocracking catalyst synthesis<text>In order to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of mesoporous nanosized beta zeolites in the process of crude oil direct hydrocracking, a set of six hydrocracking catalysts was prepared by using the modified nanosized beta zeolites. The hydrocracking catalysts were formulated as a combination including hierarchical beta zeolites, large-pore alumina (sasol PURALOX TH100/150, with a specific surface area of 201.6 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.96 ml/g), MoO3, nickel nitrate hexahydrate, and binder (partially acid-peptized alumina, sasol, CATAPAL B). These were meticulously blended to create a homogenous mixture suitable for extrusion. The combination underwent extrusion to produce extrudate with a cylindrical shape. Subsequently, it was subjected to drying at a temperature of 110 C for the duration of one night. Finally, the extrudate was calcined in an air environment at a temperature of 500 C for 4 h. The composition of all catalysts is the same, consisting of MoO3 (15 wt%), NiO (5 wt%), zeolite (50 wt%), and alumina (30 wt%). The formulated hydrocracking catalysts with the following zeolites: NB-C, NB-NC, NB-C-BT, NB-NC-HT, NB-NC-BT, and NB-NC-BT-wCTAB were designated as HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, HC-5 and HC-6, respectively.",

The hierarchical HZSM-5 was obtained by the alkali desilication pretreatment. First of all, the calcined HZSM-5 (550 C for 5 h) was treated by NaOH solution with 0.3 mol/l at 80 C for 30 min. Because the NaOH concentration of 0.3 mol/l has been proved to obtain maximum aromatics\u2019 yield during biomass CFP according to the previous works [29,36]. Then, the hierarchical HZSM-5 was obtained after the following steps of deionized water washing, ion exchanged in 1.0 mol/l NH4NO3 solution, and calcination. After that, the Ga precursor solution was mixed with the hierarchical HZSM-5 where the Ga metal content was fixed at 2 wt%. The Ga/hierarchical-HZSM-5 was obtained after the following steps of water evaporation, drying, and calcination. The parent, alkali treated, and metal modification catalysts were abbreviated as Parent-H, Hie-H, and Ga/Hie-H. The textural properties, acidity, and morphology of catalysts were tested by BET, NH3-TPD, SEM/TEM, respectively. Detailed experimental process of these four analytical instruments could be observed in our previous publications [3,4].",

LDPE was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. <header>Synthesis of HZZ by employing NCC as the mesoporous template<text>The HZZ catalyst was synthesized by conventional hydrothermal method with NCC template. The effect of NCC addition amounts (only ZSM-5, 2.5 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 %) and Si/Al ratios (SARs, only ZSM-5, 80, 100 and 150) on the properties of HZZ were investigated. Specially, an appropriate amount of C9H21AlO3 was weighed and added to deionized water. Then a certain amount of TPAOH was added to the C9H21AlO3 solution and stirred for 2 h at room temperature until the solution was clear and transparent. Next, a certain amount of TEOS was added to the mixtures and stirring the solution for 2 h until the solution was clear and transparent again, and kept at 80 C for 12 h to form the crystal. Then the NCC was added into it after sonicating for 30 min to make it evenly dispersed. The resulted homogeneous white emulsion was heated at 180 C for 24 h in an autoclave, then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min after cooling to room temperature. The solid was collected and washed 3 times repeatedly, then dried at 80 C for 12 h. The resulting white solid was calcined at 550 C for 6 h in a muffle furnace, then the HZZ was obtained, which was noted as X% NCC-ZSM-5 (Y), where X% is the mass ratio of NCC to SiO2 and Y is the SAR.",

The zeolites were calcined in muffle furnace in 550 C for 5 h to remove the template, water and other adsorption impurities. Bifunctional catalysts with Ni loading of 5 % were prepared by equal volume impregnation method using HZSM-5 zeolites with different silica-aluminum ratios. The loading is the mass ratio of the metal element to the HZSM-5, and the prepared catalysts were expressed as 5Ni/Z-X (5 denotes 5 % loading of metal Ni on the catalyst; X = 18, 25, 50, 80, 100, representing the silica-alumina ratios of the zeolites). Loading of metals on HZSM-5 support was conducted by equal volume impregnating HZSM-5 in Ni(CH\u2083COO)\u2082\u00b74H\u2082O solution at room temperature (20 C) for 24 h. The prepared catalysts were dried in air at 50 C and 100 C for 5 h in a drying oven. Then catalysts were calcined in air at 500 C for 4 h in a furnace. HZSM-5 zeolites with a Silica-alumina ratio of 25 was selected and loaded with different Ni contents, and the catalysts were noted as xNi/Z-25 (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, denoting the loading of the Ni as x%), respectively.",

Then a certain amount of water, aluminium isopropoxide and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were added to the solution. Final molar ratio of Al2O3: SiO2: TPAOH: Na2O: H2O is 1:50:10:7.11:2500. The mixture was agitated for 2 h at room temperature and was heated at 120 C for 72 h in hydrothermal vessel. The suspension was centrifugated and then dried at 60 C for 12 h. The solid was calcined at 550 C for 5 h. Ion exchange was done using 1 M solution of NH4NO3 at 80 C for 4 h by two same processes\u00b7NH3-ZSM-5 was calcined at 450 C for 3 h to obtain H-ZSM-5. Mesoporous HZSM-5 was prepared by NaOH treatment. The process was carried out using 0.1 mol/L NaOH solutions at 70 C for 30 min. After treatment, mesoporous ZSM-5 was obtained by filtration, drying, and calcination at 300 C for 5 h. SiO2 modified mesoporous ZSM-5 was done using chemical liquid deposition method. 10 g of the zeolite was suspended in 100 ml hexane and heated with stirring under reflux conditions. 0.6 ml TEOS was added into the mixture. The silylation was carried out for 1 h. Then hexane was volatilized by evacuation. The mixture was dried at 100 C for 2 h and calcined at 500 C for 4 h. The process was performed repeatedly for three times. In this study, mesoporous ZSM-5 was named as MZ5, SiO2 modification mesoporous ZSM-5 was named as SiMZ5.",

        "text": "<header>Synthesis of EMT zeolite<text>The synthesis of EMT zeolite was adapted from a method proposed in the literature [3]. The reagents used as sources of silicon and aluminum were silica Ludox 30 wt% (Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium aluminate (aluminate (AlO2 1-), sodium (1:1) \u2013 Fisher), 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (18-crown-6 \u2265 99.0 % Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). The stoichiometric molar ratio of the synthesis gel was as follows: 0.044 NaAlO2: 0.64 SiO2: 0.017 18-crown-6: 1.17 H2O. The procedure for the synthesis gel preparation involves, under constant stirring, the dissolution of the sodium hydroxide in milli-Q water and the subsequent addition of sodium aluminate (stirring for 15 min), the 18-crown-6 (stirring for 1 h) and 30 wt% Ludox silica (stirring for 1 h). All these steps were performed at room temperature. The synthesis gel was placed in Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave reactors, left for 24 h at room temperature and subsequently subjected to crystallization under autogenous pressure and static conditions at 110 C for 13 d. After crystallization, the so obtained solid was recovered by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water (until the pH reached neutral value), and dried at 100 C for 12 h. Finally, the material was calcined at 550 C for 6 h with a heating ratio of 1 C\u00b7min-1 and coded as EMT.<header>Post-synthesis method to produce hierarchical EMT zeolite<text>The post-synthesis treatment was performed using 1 g of calcined EMT zeolite in a solution containing 1.3 g of ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Sigma-Aldrich, 98 %) and 6 g of H2O. In a second series of experiments, 0.7 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Aldrich, 99 %) was also added to the solution. The mixture was subjected to ultrasound at temperatures of 25 and 65 C for times of 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h with frequency 40 KHz. Then, it was vacuum filtered, the recovered solid being washed carefully with distilled water until the pH reached a neutral value, dried in an oven at 100 C for 12 h, and calcined at 550 C for 6 h. Samples were coded as E-D x y +C, where D indicates that the catalyst has the demetallization treatment, x and y represent time and temperature (if not carried out at room temperature) of this treatment, respectively, whereas +C indicates that the sample has been prepared in the presence of CTAB. To obtain the EMT zeolite in its protonic form, 1 g of the calcined zeolite was subjected to an ion exchange procedure using 100 mL of a 1 mol.L-1 ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution at 80 C for 2 h, under agitation in a reflux system. Subsequently, the solid was vacuum filtered, washed with approximately 1 L of distilled water at 80 C to remove unexchanged ammonium ions (NH4 +) and chloride ions (Cl-) and then oven dried at 100 C. To ensure an efficient ion exchange process, this procedure was repeated 3 times. Then, the zeolite was calcined at 400 C with a heating rate of 10 C.min-1 for 3 h. The resulting material was named as H-EMT.",

Before the experiment, it was crushed and sieved to obtain powder with a particle size of about 100 mesh and then dried at 110 C for 48 h. The proximate analysis of the air-dried basis bamboo was 71.42 wt.% volatile, 7.36 wt.% moisture, 2.94 wt.% ash and 18.28 wt.% fixed carbon, and the ultimate analysis of the daf (dry and ash free) basis bamboo was 51.51 wt.% carbon, 6.12 wt.% hydrogen, 42.05 wt.% oxygen, 0.21 wt.% nitrogen and 0.11 wt.% sulfur. <header>Chemical liquid deposition of HZSM-5 catalysts<text>10 g HZSM-5 was dissolved into 100 mL pure ethyl alcohol in a conical flask; a corresponding amount of TBT modifier was then added to the slurry, and the mix was left in a water bath at 40 \u2103 for 4 h. After reaction, the liquid was steamed in a rotary evaporation device, and the resultant specimen was placed in an oven to dry at 105 \u2103 for 12 h, before being finally calcined at 550 \u2103 for 4 h. The SiO2-modified samples were prepared in the same manner, except that the modifier and solvent were changed to TEOS and n-hexane, respectively. Catalysts with different deposition amounts and times were also prepared, and catalysts that contained x wt.% (x = 2, 4, 8, 12) TiO2/SiO2, with 4 h deposition time, were named \u201cx% TiO2/SiO2-HZ\u201d.",
