Although zeolites hold promise for carbon capture, the development of advanced zeolite materials with optimized CO2 separation efficiency and diffusivity remains challenging. In this study, we present a quantum dot-regulated growth strategy, in which silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) act as heterogeneous seeds to not only initiate the growth of nanoscale zeolite units but also guide their assembly. The resulting 13X-SiQDs exhibit a distinct micrometer-scale hollow sphere structure composed of nanoscale zeolite units, which provide additional adsorption sites and mesopores, significantly enhancing adsorption and diffusion. The amino groups on the surface of the SiQDs further enable chemical adsorption with CO2, strengthening the binding force. The synergistic combination of thermodynamic and kinetic advantages enables 13X-SiQDs to achieve substantial improvements in CO2 adsorption capacity (132.20 cm3·g−1), CO2/N2 selectivity (561), and diffusion rate. This quantum dot-regulated synthesis strategy offers a promising approach for designing advanced adsorption materials with high performance, extending their potential applications beyond carbon capture.",

          "Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is a primary driver of the greenhouse effect, significantly hindering the achievement of the Paris Agreement's climate goals [1]. As a critical strategy to mitigate carbon emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies employ various methods to reduce CO2 emissions, particularly from industrial sources that burn fossil fuels [2–4]. Post-combustion CO2 capture, which primarily involves CO2/N2 separation at low concentrations (<15 %) and pressures (0.1–1.0 bar), is a widely accepted solution for CO2 mitigation [5]. Conventional “wet-scrubbing” technology, which relies on chemisorption with monoethanolamine (MEA), has been industrially employed for over 50 years [6–9]. However, this method incurs significant energy penalties due to the need for MEA regeneration and suffers from high solvent loss due to degradation and evaporation [10]. In contrast, solid adsorption technologies offer a promising, energy-efficient alternative for carbon capture, with advantages such as low cost, simplicity, and environmental sustainability.",
          "Thus, there is an urgent need for novel sorbent materials for CO2/N2 separation, possessing high CO2 adsorption capacity at low pressures, high CO2/N2 selectivity, rapid adsorption/desorption kinetics, good stability under variable temperatures and humid conditions, and low-temperature recyclability [11]. Various solid adsorbents, including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [12–14], zeolites [15–17], activated carbons [18–20], and porous silica materials [21–23], have been investigated. Among these, zeolites are particularly promising for CCS due to their high specific surface area, tunable structure, good hydrothermal stability, and low cost [24–29]. Zeolite 13X, a representative FAU-type zeolite with a low silicon-to-aluminum ratio, high hydrothermal stability, and high CO2 adsorption capacity, has shown particular promise for CO2/N2 separation. Its framework primarily consists of 6-ring (β-cage) and 12-ring (α-cage) supercages, which allow cation mobility (e.g., Na + ) [30,31]. The α-cages are accessible to CO2 molecules, but the intrinsic micropores (<1 nm) limit mass transfer and diffusion of gaseous adsorbates, reducing separation efficiency and increasing energy consumption [32].",
          "Currently, several synthetic strategies focus on regulating the growth of zeolite crystals to reduce micropore diffusion resistance and enhance gas separation performance [33]. A promising approach involves developing hierarchically porous zeolites with synergistic pore structures that shorten the diffusion Distance [34–36]. For example, single-crystal hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, which incorporate hexagonal mesopores within a complete microporous framework, can enhance transport capacity and improve accessibility to active sites [37]. Reducing the particle size of zeolite crystals from micrometers to nanometers is another effective strategy to promote diffusion, which can further expose more active sites for adsorption [38–44]. Nanocrystals synthesized through specialized methods reduce mass transfer resistance, providing shorter diffusion paths and accelerating CO2 adsorption/desorption kinetics [45]. Consequently, combining nanoscale and multi-level structures offers significant potential to improve the diffusion and separation properties of zeolite materials.",
          "To overcome the diffusion limitations in zeolite micropores and further enhance CO2 adsorption capacity, we use silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) as crystallization seeds to regulate zeolite growth, resulting in a new host–guest composite material (13X-SiQDs). In this composite, zeolite 13X serves as the host framework, and SiQDs with amine groups on their surface act as the guest. Compared to conventional micrometer-scale 13X zeolite, the 13X-SiQDs exhibit a unique hollow spherical structure composed of nanoscale zeolite units embedded with ultrasmall SiQDs, characterized by jagged external surfaces and internal hierarchical pores. The quantum dots induce a layered growth structure in the 13X zeolite, significantly enhancing its specific surface area and promoting CO2 diffusion. Additionally, the amino groups on the SiQDs surface provide extra adsorption sites for CO2, further improving the CO2 adsorption capacity. This composite unique structure of the material, with newly created pores and enhanced diffusion paths, substantially improves both adsorption and separation capabilities."

          "We developed a quantum dot regulation strategy to synthesize 13X-SiQDs zeolite with a hierarchical assembly structure, facilitating enhanced CO2 adsorption and diffusion. Silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) with an average particle size of approximately 5.0 nm were prepared via a hydrothermal method (Fig. S1). Infrared spectroscopy revealed a bending vibration peak at 1580 cm−1 and a stretching vibration peak at 3434 cm−1, both characteristic of N–H bonds (Fig. S2). Additionally, XPS analysis showed a peak at 101.2 eV, corresponding to Si-N bonds (Fig. S3). These results confirm that the silicon quantum dots are functionalized with amino groups on their surface. The ultra-small size and surface functionalization of the silicon quantum dots endow them with high chemical activity, enabling interactions with FAU zeolite precursors and effectively regulating their crystal growth process. Time evolution experiments (Fig. 1 ) show that Si quantum dots (SiQDs) play a crucial role in zeolite crystal growth and effectively regulate zeolite morphology. SiQDs function as heterogeneous nucleating agents, facilitating initial size control and promoting nucleation over crystal growth (Fig. 1a). The subsequent directional aggregation of zeolite nanoparticles is driven by the system’s tendency to minimize its Gibbs free energy, resulting in growth along thermodynamically preferred directions and the formation of sub-nanometer crystals that tend to assemble (Fig. 1b). Finally, neighboring zeolite nanoparticles aggregate into larger structures via intraparticle maturation, forming micron-sized zeolites with spherical morphology and a jagged, nanoflower-like surface (Fig. 1c). Elemental analysis of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra reveals that the Si/Al ratio of 13X-SiQDs (1.50) is higher than that of 13X (1.23), suggesting incorporation of SiQDs into the zeolite matrix. As expected, 13X-SiQDs emit blue fluorescence at 450 nm when excited at 365 nm, whereas 13X does not, further confirming the integration of SiQDs into the zeolite framework (Fig. S4-5)."

          "The microstructural features of 13X-SiQDs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images reveal that the original 13X particles were octahedral, with sizes ranging from approximately 500 to 700 nm (Fig. S6). Upon the addition of silicon quantum dots, the surface morphology of the zeolite changed significantly. As the quantity of silicon quantum dots increased, the surface of the zeolite transitioned from smooth to rough, and the jagged, nanoflower-like structure became more prominent (Fig. 2 a-d). TEM images of 13X-SiQDs clearly show the secondary growth of assembled nanoparticles (Fig. 2e), with lattice fringes corresponding to the (111) plane of SiQDs observed (Fig. 2f). This suggests that the primary nanoparticles of FAU zeolite aggregate into larger nanoparticles under the induction of silicon quantum dots, resulting in the appearance of interconnected mesopores in the integrated nanocrystals.",
          "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 13X and 13X-SiQDs are shown in Fig. 3 a. Both samples exhibit diffraction peaks well-indexed to the FAU zeolite structure (PDF#38–0237), with characteristic peaks corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (331), (533), (642), and (751) planes at 2θ values of 6.1°, 9.9°, 11.7°, 15.4°, 23.3°, 26.6°, and 31.0°, respectively. XRD analysis confirms that the prepared zeolite has good crystallinity, suggesting that the incorporation of SiQDs does not adversely affect the crystallization process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further supports the introduction of nitrogen-containing groups from the silicon quantum dots into the zeolite structure (Fig. 3b).",
          "To examine the effect of quantum dot modification on the pore structure of zeolites, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured for 13X and 13X-SiQDs (Fig. 3c), with the corresponding pore structure parameters summarized in Table S1. The 13X zeolite exhibited typical type I adsorption behavior, indicative of a purely microporous structure. In contrast, 13X-SiQDs demonstrated a sharp increase in adsorption at low pressure (P/P 0 < 0.1), corresponding to the microporous region, along with a hysteresis loop at higher P/P 0 values (P/P 0 = 0.5–1.0), characteristic of mesoporous features. The H4-type hysteresis loop observed suggests the presence of a micro-mesoporous structure formed by aggregated zeolite crystals, likely due to the presence of narrow crack-like pores. Both 13X and 13X-SiQDs belong to the FAU zeolite family, with their primary pores being spherical supercages composed of sodalite cages, featuring diameters of 1.3 nm and pore sizes ranging from 0.71 to 0.73 nm. However, 13X-SiQDs also exhibits an additional mesoporous structure induced by quantum dot modification. To further evaluate the impact of this modification on the zeolite pore size, the mesopore size distribution was analyzed using the BJH method (Fig. 3d). While the original 13X zeolite lacked mesoporous features, 13X-SiQDs displayed mesopores ranging from 3 to 10 nm, with a peak at approximately 3.86 nm. Compared to 13X, the specific surface area of 13X-SiQDs increased from 788.07 m2·g−1 to 930.56 m2·g−1, and the mesopore volume from 0.03 cm3·g−1 to 0.09 cm3·g−1. These findings indicate that silicon quantum dot modification enhances the specific surface area and introduces mesoporous structures in 13X-SiQDs. According to pore-filling theory, the hierarchical pore structure of 13X-SiQDs is expected to exhibit distinct CO2 capture behavior compared to 13X."

          "To evaluate the adsorption and separation potential of the materials for CO2/N2, the CO2 and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 13X and 13X-SiQDs were measured at 298 K and pressures up to 1.0 bar (Fig. 4 a). At 1.0 bar, 13X-SiQDs exhibited a higher CO2 and N2 adsorption capacity than 13X, likely due to the larger BET surface area and nanoparticle assembly structure of 13X-SiQDs, which provide additional adsorption sites for gas molecules. Specifically, CO2 adsorption increased from 113 cm3·g−1 to 134 cm3·g−1, while N2 adsorption rose from 5.83 cm3·g−1 to 6.25 cm3·g−1. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST), developed by Myers and Prausnitz, is the most widely used approach for predicting mixed-gas adsorption isotherms, relying exclusively on single-component adsorption data [47]. The CO2 selectivity of 13X and 13X-SiQDs was estimated using IAST, as shown in Fig. 4b (CO2:N2 = 0.15:0.85). At 1 bar, relevant to CO2 capture from flue gas, the CO2 selectivity of 13X and 13X-SiQDs are 243 and 561, respectively. Fig. 4c compares the CO2 selectivity of several representative materials, highlighting the superior CO2 capture performance of 13X-SiQDs. In addition to static adsorption equilibrium studies, dynamic breakthrough experiments were performed to evaluate the separation of CO2/N2 mixtures using 13X and 13X-SiQDs (Fig. 4d). During these experiments, N2 was detected immediately, while CO2 broke through after a delay, aligning well with the predictions from the IAST analysis. The breakthrough time interval between CO2 and N2 in 13X-SiQDs was significantly longer than that in 13X. This result indicates that 13X-SiQDs demonstrates superior adsorption and separation performance for CO2 compared to 13X (Table S3). To assess the reproducible working ability of 13X-SiQDs, adsorption–desorption cycle experiments were conducted at 298 K (Fig. 4e). The results demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption capacity remained nearly constant over five cycles, indicating excellent reversibility and reusability.",
          "To evaluate the feasibility of 13X-SiQDs for industrial applications, their performance was compared with 13X through kinetic experiments. Fig. 5a shows a comparison of the CO2 breakthrough curves for both zeolites, starting from the breakthrough point under identical test conditions. The time from CO2 breakthrough to complete breakthrough for 13X-SiQDs is significantly shorter than that for 13X, indicating improved diffusion performance. Based on these breakthrough experiments, the calculated diffusion rate for 13X-SiQDs (0.0345 cm2·s−1) is higher than that for 13X (0.0137 cm2·s−1). This difference can be attributed to the nano-sized zeolite assembly and the resulting mesopores both inside and outside the structure. In a pure 1 bar CO2 atmosphere, 13X-SiQDs also exhibits a shorter adsorption equilibrium time, enhancing adsorption efficiency (Fig. 5b). To further elucidate the adsorption behavior, the pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models were applied to fit the experimental data (Fig. 5c-d). The adsorption capacity (q) fitted by the pseudo-first-order model is closer to the experimental adsorption results for 13X, suggesting that 13X primarily undergoes physical adsorption (R2 = 0.9687) (Table S4). In contrast, the adsorption curve of 13X-SiQDs more closely fits the pseudo-second-order model, indicating that its adsorption behavior likely involves both physical and chemical adsorption (R2 = 0.9589) (Table S4)."

          "The isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) for CO2 and N2 on the synthesized zeolites were calculated as a function of gas loading using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to represent the binding enthalpies. The heat of adsorption reflects the interaction strength between the gas and zeolite. The heat of adsorption of CO2 of 13X and 13X-SiQDs is significantly higher than that of N2, indicating a stronger binding affinity to CO2, which is advantageous for CO2/N2 separation (Fig. 6 a-b). The zero-coverage Q st value of CO2 in 13X-SiQDs (57.4 kJ·mol−1) is notably higher than that in 13X (38.5 kJ·mol−1). Generally, the heat of physical adsorption, including CO2, does not exceed 42 kJ·mol−1. For 13X-SiQDs, the Q st for CO2 gradually decreases with increasing adsorption, transitioning from chemical adsorption to physical adsorption. This suggests that, in addition to the electric quadrupole interaction between the zeolite framework and CO2, chemical adsorption processes also contribute. Chemisorption is thermodynamically more favorable than physisorption, but it is limited by the availability of adsorption sites.",
          "To further investigate the adsorption mechanism of CO2 by zeolites, in situ infrared spectra of 13X and 13X-SiQDs were measured at 30 °C. Before the measurement, the sample was purged and heated, and the spectrum was tested as background to clearly observe the contribution of CO2 adsorption. As shown in Fig. 6c, the 13X zeolite exhibits only a peak shift in the range of 2300–2400 cm−1, corresponding to the physical adsorption of CO2 [48]. This indicates that 13X primarily adsorbs CO2 through physical interactions. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6d, 13X-SiQDs show peak shifts associated with both physical adsorption (2300–2400 cm−1) and chemical adsorption of CO2 (1300–1500 cm−1). Specifically, the peak near 1400 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of C–N or the skeletal vibration of NCOO– [49,50], while the peak near 1480 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of COO– [50–52]. These results suggest that CO2 reacts with the amino groups of 13X-SiQDs to form carbamate under anhydrous conditions. Consistent with the previously proposed CO2 adsorption mechanism [52,53], amino groups tend to form weakly chemically adsorbed carbamic acid species under anhydrous conditions rather than carbamate ion species, which are associated with stronger chemical adsorption. Based on these results, we conclude that 13X-SiQDs may capture CO2 through the synergistic effect of physical and chemical adsorption. The introduction of amino groups enhances the binding affinity of CO2 to the material via weak chemical adsorption, while the hierarchical assembly structure of nanozeolites, regulated by quantum dots, provides additional adsorption sites for physical adsorption. This dual mechanism ultimately increases the CO2 adsorption capacity of 13X-SiQDs."

Breakthrough experiments and kinetic adsorption tests further confirm the practical feasibility of using 13X-SiQDs for CO2/N2 separation, with enhanced gas diffusion and transfer. Therefore, the SiQDs-mediated synthesis strategy for zeolites offers broad applicability and can be extended to other types of porous materials."

Most importantly, the addition sequence of carbon black can impact the porosity of hierarchical TS-1. The hierarchical zeolite is synthesized by incorporating 0.2 g carbon black into the seeds. When carbon black is firstly combined with seeds, the enhanced interaction facilitates the subsequent growth process, leading to large surface area from mesopores (121 m2/g) and abundant pores size (8–40 nm) and enhanced exposure of Ti active sites. The optimized hierarchical TS-1 possesses excellent catalytic performance with high conversion rate (24.4 %) and similar selectivity (93.8 %), which are 1.6 times higher than that of traditional TS-1 zeolites.",

          "As a typical zeolite with MFI structure, titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) zeolite has attracted much attention in the past few decades for its excellent catalytic performance in the epoxidation of olefins by hydrogen peroxide, which is green and pollution-free [1–5]. Epoxides, which often serve as intermediates in pharmaceutical, environmental, and chemical products, raises significant environmental and safety concerns, particularly industrial applications [6]. However, average pore size of traditional TS-1 zeolite is only 0.55 nm, which obviously hinders the participation of some macromolecular substances in the conversion, reducing its diffusion ability and the active site [7]. This confinement effect, while beneficial for catalytic selectivity, can create significant mass transfer resistance, especially for larger molecules or during complex reaction pathways [8]. The narrow pore openings in microporous zeolites can impede the diffusion of reactants, leading to slower reaction rates and reduced efficiency in catalytic processes. Several studies have shown that the diffusivity within micropores is highly dependent on factors such as pore size, shape, and the presence of defects, which can either facilitate or hinder diffusion [9,10]. Additionally, the interaction between reactants and the zeolite framework within these micropores can further affect the overall transport behavior, influencing not only the rate of diffusion but also the thermodynamic properties of the system [11]. To overcome these limitations, it is needed to design hierarchical TS-1 zeolite which can reduce the spatial restriction of the conversion macromolecules, increase the rate of intracrystalline diffusion, and regulate the selectivity of the products [12–14].",
          "Hierarchical zeolites have attracted significant attention due to their improved active sites and diffusion rates for reactant and product molecules (mass transfer properties), providing a potential solution to the limitations of conventional zeolite structures [10]. Common methods for synthesizing hierarchical zeolite mainly include post-processing and template method [15]. Zuo and Chen et al. synthesized hierarchical zeolite through selectively removing of Si\\Al\\Ti\\B atoms in the skeleton. The hierarchical pores can shorten the mass transfer path and promote the mass transfer diffusion, which is also conducive to the catalytic activity [16–18]. Kenvin and Li et al. modified TS-1 zeolite with different concentration of surfactants or organosilanes to obtain different hierarchical zeolites. Due to the mesoporous structure, the catalytic stability of hierarchical zeolite was most significantly improved [19,20]. Ouyang et al. designed a fully interconnected intracrystalline hierarchical TS-1, which improved the accessibility of the active site and the diffusion efficiency. The catalytic performance during the epoxidation was 2 times of the catalytic performance of commercial TS-1 zeolites [7]. Valentin et al. used steam assisted crystallization of a hierarchical TS-1 zeolite through dissolution and recrystallization upon steaming showed excellent catalytic performance in aqueous media [21]. Zhu and Fan et al. reported environmentally friendly strategy of solid-state synthesis method for producing TS-1 zeolite with fast mass transfer and increased production rates [22–24]. However, these syntheses of hierarchical zeolites were complicated and costly. There are few reports on solid-state synthesis of a hierarchical TS-1 zeolite, only in terms of influence of carbon template on the porous property [7]. It is also not established that the influence of carbon black addition sequence in the zeolite precursor on the structure properties.",
          "Here, for the purpose of enhancing production efficiency, we design a novel solid-state synthesis method for the efficient preparation of hierarchical TS-1 zeolite by precisely controlling the quantity of carbon black and the addition sequence of carbon black, which significantly impacts both crystallinity and mesoporosity of TS-1 zeolite. It demonstrates the importance of fine-tuning synthesis parameters for material optimization. Specifically, when carbon black is preferentially combined with seeds, the enhanced interaction facilitates the subsequent growth process. Without phase separation, carbon black is able to enter crystal of zeolite, enabling construction of hierarchical porous structures. The large surface area from mesopores (121 m2/g) and abundant pores size (8–40 nm) improve interaction between the active sites and macromolecules, thereby enhancing catalytic performance. The optimized hierarchical TS-1 achieves a conversion rate of 24.4 % and a selectivity of 93.8 %, which is 1.6 times higher than that of conventional TS-1 zeolite. This approach offers the characteristics of concise synthetic route, simplified procedure and environmentally friendly."

          "The synthesizing procedure of hierarchical TS-1 is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Carbon black is mixed with silica, TPAOH and seed/titanium sulfate in varying sequence, resulting in disparate diffusion rates during the crystallization process. This leads to the formation of carbon matrix in different parts of TS-1 zeolite. After calcination to remove carbon black, TS-1 with different porous structure is formed. XRD patterns of TS-1 zeolite synthesized with different amounts of carbon black (Fig. 2 ) shows characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to MFI structure indicating that all samples have good crystallinity [25–29]. The crystallinity of TS-1 zeolite with 0.2 g carbon black is defined as 100 %. The relative crystallinity (R.C) of TS-1 zeolite with the different amounts of carbon black is calculated by comparing the total intensity of five characteristic peaks (7.9°, 8.8°, 23.0°, 23.9° and 24.3°) correspond to (011), (200), (501), (422) and (133), respectively, crystal planes of MFI structure (JCPDF no. 44–0696). When the amount of carbon black is increased to 0.4 g, the corresponded relative crystallinity of TS-1 zeolite is only 60 % compared with that of zeolite synthesized by adding 0.2 g carbon black. This is due to the incompatibility between hydrophobic carbon black and aqueous zeolite precursors. A large amount of carbon black occupy more reaction space and reduce the viscosity of the synthesis system, seriously inhibiting the transfer and migration between zeolite precursors. Nevertheless, when the amount of carbon black is 0.05 g and 0.1 g, the relative crystallinity is only 94 % and 87 %, respectively, which is markedly inferior to that of 0.2 g carbon black.",
          "Furthermore, morphology could be clearly observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TS-1 catalysts using different amounts of carbon black (Fig. S1). When the amount of carbon black is 0.05 g and 0.1 g, the surface of the obtained samples is rough, and there is no obvious hexagonal prism zeolite morphology. When the amount of carbon black is increased to 0.2 g, the morphology of the zeolite shows a large number of hexagonal prisms. Meanwhile, the large pores are appeared on both ends and surfaces of the zeolite, which is due to the calcination of the carbon black wrapped in the interior of the zeolite during the crystallization of the zeolite [30]. However, when the amount of carbon black reaches to 0.4 g, the synthesized sample has a smooth surface, and the morphology tends to be hexagonal prism without mesoporous structure. Some unstructured substances are attached to the surface of the zeolite, which may be carbon matrix. Obviously, when the amount of carbon black increases from 0.05 g to 0.4 g, the growth trend of TS-1 zeolite is along the (010) plane. It can be seen that the formation of mesoporous structure is related to the amount of carbon black. This may be due to the excessive carbon black occupies the reaction space, which leading the carbon black is difficult to be wrapped in the zeolite.",
          "We explore different adding sequences of carbon black into the precursor can greatly impact the porosity of zeolite. SEM images of all samples with different grinding sequences show the particle size is around 1–2 μm with good dispersion (Fig. 3 a–c). The surface of all zeolites is smooth and hexagonal prism, which is a typical MFI zeolite morphology. However, SEM and TEM images (Fig. 3d, Fig.S2a and Fig.S2b) of HTS-1+CB + Seeds sample reveal a relatively high density of mesopores with a fairly uniform pore size distribution. Additionally, Fig. S2c shows the lattice stripe spacing of 1.11 nm corresponded to the (011) plane of MFI structure (JCPDS no. 44–0696). Moreover, as shown in Figs. S2d–e, the elemental mapping images of HTS-1+CB + Seeds disclose that the Si, O and Ti elements are distributed on the surface. On the contrary, the amount of mesopores in HTS-1+CB + TPAOH is low compared with that of HTS-1+CB + Seeds (Fig. 3e). For the sample of HTS-1+CB + SiO2 (Fig. 3f), the mesopores tend to aggregate to form large pores inside the particles. Therefore, the porosity of TS-1 can be tuned by the addition sequence of carbon black.",
          "As shown in Fig. 4c, nitrogen sorption isotherms of all samples demonstrate the type IV adsorption isotherm with a H2 type hysteresis loop. The low partial pressure uptake (P/P 0 < 0.1) of the three hierarchical zeolite samples is similar to that of the conventional TS-1. For conventional TS-1, it shows a rapid uptake at low relative pressure P/P 0 < 0.1 and hysteresis loop under the lower relative pressure (P/P 0 = 0.48–1.0), demonstrate more microporous characteristics However, the three hierarchical TS-1 samples exhibit a hysteresis loop under the higher relative pressure (P/P 0 = 0.78–1.0), which reflect the existence of amount of mesopores [31]. Fig. 4d shows all samples has the pore size distribution of 1.7 and 3.8 nm microporous structure. Compare with other hierarchical TS-1 samples, the peaks distribution of HTS-1-CB + Seeds at the pore diameter of 8–40 nm are higher, indicating that more mesopores are existed within this range. Furthermore, the mesoporous specific surface area of HTS-1-CB + Seeds (121 m2/g) is greater than that of HTS-1-CB + SiO2 (81 m2/g) and HTS-1-CB + TPAOH (70 m2/g) (Table S1), which also demonstrate that there are more mesoporous in the interior of HTS-1-CB + Seeds, which is consistent with the results of the nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves [40,41]. These results are in accordance with TEM results. This can be attributed to the preferential combination between carbon black and seeds, which enhances interaction forces and facilitates subsequent growth processes [42,43]. Without phase separation, carbon black is able to enter crystal of zeolite, enabling construction of hierarchical porous structures. Nevertheless, when carbon black is initially combined with SiO2 during the growth of zeolite, SiO2 is inclined to be absorbed while carbon black is susceptible to agglomeration. Even without phase separation occurring, the formation of large pores in TS-1 zeolite results in a reduction in the mesoporous surface area. When carbon black is initially combined with TPAOH, the TS-1 crystals preferentially grow around the seed, with TPAOH assisting in growth and being absorbed. As a result, relatively fewer mesopores are formed. In addition, to further understand the coordination states of titanium species, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is conducted on all of the hierarchical TS-1 zeolites (Fig. 4e). All samples show two characteristics peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 corresponding to the tetrahedral Ti in the hierarchical TS-1 zeolite, and the binding energy shift could be attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies around Ti [27].",
          "The epoxidation of 1-hexene has recently garnered significant interest within the chemical industry, as 1,2-epoxyhexane represents a crucial intermediate in the manufacture of a range of chemical products [44–46]. However, due to its high molecular weight, the developed catalysts typically necessitate the incorporation of mesoporous structures to enhance its conversion efficiency [47–51]. By investigating the reaction mechanisms and catalytic properties of these macromolecules, it is possible to enhance the catalytic efficiency, reduce by-product formation and implement a more environmentally friendly production process in the chemical industry. The conversion of 1-hexene and epoxide selectivity are shown in Fig. 5 a. HTS-1-CB + Seeds shows more outstanding catalytic performance in the oxidation reaction of 1-hexene, with a conversion rate of 24.4 % and a selectivity of 93.8 %. The conversion rate of HTS-1-CB + SiO2 and HTS-1-CB + TPAOH is only 21.9 % and 19.5 %, respectively. For conventional TS-1, the conversion is 15.3 % and the selectivity is 95.4 %. This is related to the mesoporous structure in HTS-1 zeolite, which not only improves the mass transfer capacity of its macromolecules, but also accelerates product separation [52]. Even more to the point, mesoporous structures can expose more internal Ti active sites and improve the accessibility of reactants and oxidants to active sites [40,53,54]. In order to test the stability of TS-1+CB + Seeds catalyst, the cycling experiments are performed. As shown in Fig. 5b, the conversion of 1-hexene increases significantly from 13.5 % to 24.2 % with the increase time (0.5–9 h). Meanwhile, the selectivity of the hexene oxide decreases slightly. It can be seen that the presence of 10–20 nm mesoporous structures in HTS-1-CB + Seeds facilitates the exposure of titanium species and the mass transfer of macromolecules. In addition, XRD pattern of cyclic catalyst shows that all samples maintain the MFI crystal structure (Fig. 5c), demonstrating that TS-1 with hierarchical porous structure possesses good stability. Additionally, a comparison of HTS-1+CB + Seeds with several catalysts is demonstrated in Table 1 , the results show that the catalytic performance of epoxide 1-hexene synthesized by TS-1+CB + Seeds by adjusting the addition sequence of raw materials is better than that of most reported literatures."

          "In summary, a solid-state synthesis method is developed for the efficient preparation of hierarchical TS-1 zeolite by precisely controlling the addition sequence of raw materials and regulating the quantity of carbon black. Altering the amount of carbon black significantly impacts both crystallinity and morphology of TS-1 zeolite. Different addition sequences of carbon black which directly influence pore size distribution, which is closely associated with catalytic performance. The carbon black is firstly grinded with seeds, which can bring about substantial mesopores. The large surface area of mesopores (121 m2/g) and abundant pores size (8–40 nm) improve interaction between the active sites and macromolecules, thereby enhancing catalytic performance. The optimized hierarchical HTS-1 exhibits remarkable superiority over conventional microporous zeolite in the conversion of 1-hexene, achieving a conversion rate of 24.4 % and a selectivity of 93.8 %, which are 1.6 times higher than that of traditional TS-1 zeolites. This efficient and sustainable solid-state synthesis strategy provides a viable avenue for the industrial production of hierarchical TS-1 zeolite."

Here, we reported a closed-loop strategy using 10Ni@Beta catalyst to convert low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into naphtha (C5-C9 hydrocarbons), a major feedstock to reproduce polyolefins. The hierarchically porous Beta zeolite was constructed while encapsulating 10 % Ni loading through controlled dissolution-recrystallization. An 88.0 % liquid yield was obtained and the selectivity of naphtha reached 99.1 % at 250 °C within 2 h reaction, surpassing previously reported Pt-based catalysts. The engineered meso-microporous architecture with confined Ni nanoparticles mimicked the mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed process, where the initial cracked LDPE fragments at surface acid were selectively transferred into mesopore channels and further screened by micropores with suitable size to contact Ni sites for hydrogenation. This designed porous catalyst matched the tandem catalytic process of multiple real-life polyolefins, enabling the industrial upcycling of plastic wastes.",

          "The global production of plastic is about 400 million tons/year, which provide great convenience in life but also produce a large amount of plastic wastes [1–4]. Due to chemical inertness, plastic wastes are difficult to decompose under natural conditions. Consequently, the majority of these materials are either consigned to landfills or subjected to incineration, leading to a significant loss of carbon and hydrogen resources and contributing to severe environmental pollution [5–8]. Polyethylene is one of the five general plastics, and it makes up the main part of waste plastic upcycling [3,9–12]. At present, chemical upcycling like pyrolysis, hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking are widely used to deconstruct low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into various fuels and chemicals with a broad distribution range of gasoline and lubricant (C5-C40 hydrocarbons) [13–20]. Considering the monomer of polyethylene is ethylene and mainly produced by industrial steam cracking of naphtha (C5-C9 hydrocarbons), we propose a closed-loop strategy for waste polyethylene upcycling in Fig. 1. In this strategy, plastic wastes are catalytically converted into products with high selectivity of naphtha [21,22], which serves as the main feedstock for producing new plastics, thereby creating a sustainable and circular approach for plastic waste management. The deconstruction of LDPE can be achieved by hydrocracking using a dual-function catalyst with balanced metal and acid sites [23–25]. The combination of Pt/WO3/ZrO2 and HY zeolite converted LDPE into a mixture of C5-C22 hydrocarbons with an 72 % yield of gasoline (C5-C12) at 250 °C and 3 MPa H2 [24], and Pt/5Ce-HY catalyst achieved a 80.9 % yield of liquid at 300 °C with 99 % selectivity of gasoline [25]. We previously reported a tandem conversion of LDPE with Pt@S-1 and Beta zeolite, which provided a high liquid yield and the selectivity of C5-C9 naphtha reached 96.8 % at 250 °C [26].",
          "Recently, cheap and robust catalysts have been selected as alternatives for the upgrading of plastic wastes [27,28]. The hydrocracking of polyolefins with MoSx and H-Beta exhibited an 81.1 % selectivity of gasoline [29], and the 5Ni/BEA achieved a maximum 80 % yield of C5-C12 product with 12 h reaction at 250 °C [30]. However, the production of narrow-distributed C5-C9 hydrocarbons remains scarcely reported, primarily due to the difficulty of selectively cleavage of polyolefins at mild reaction conditions. Compared to Pt, Ni exhibits weaker dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage capabilities. Consequently, higher loading (5–15 %) is required to improve its activity. This increased loading is prone to induce metal aggregation, thereby diminishing catalytic performance. Encapsulating metal into support represents a typical way to avoid particle growth [31,32], but there are great difficulties in embedding high-loaded Ni in zeolite while achieving high dispersion, especially for Beta zeolite. In addition, how to engineer mesoporous channels to transfer LDPE fragments into the interior for the tandem reaction at Brønsted acid and metal sites, and utilize the shape selection of micropores to screen C5-C9 hydrocarbons is another challenge.",
          "Herein, we developed a 10Ni@Beta catalyst using controlled dissolution-recrystallization strategy, which embedded 10 % Ni loading into Beta zeolite with an average metal particle size of 5.39 nm. The microporous skeleton of zeolite was partially dissolved into oligomerized species, forming 2–10 nm mesoporous channels connecting the inside and outside of Beta zeolite. At the same time, Ni was incorporated into the lattice of Beta zeolite and generated -Ni-O-Si- bonds to achieve high dispersion during the recrystallization process. For the hydrocracking of LDPE, an 88.0 % yield of liquid product was obtained with C5-C9 naphtha selectivity over 99.1 % at 250 °C and 2 h reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the rapid transport of large intermediate olefins by mesopores and the selective passing of C5-C9 products through micropores. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that the hydrogenation process was thermodynamically favored during the reaction, effectively suppressing the formation of long-chain alkanes while minimizing the production of low-value gaseous byproducts. This porous 10Ni@Beta catalyst was also efficient to deconstruct real-life plastic wastes like PE bags and PP bottles into naphtha at mild conditions, highlighting its potential for plastic wastes upcycling in the circular economy. Notably, the selective production of naphtha, a key feedstock for polyethylene manufacturing, enables a closed-loop recycling pathway, where waste plastics are converted back into raw materials for new plastic production, reducing reliance on fossil resources and enhancing sustainability."

          "The porous 10Ni@Beta catalyst was synthesized through controlled dissolution-recrystallization strategy [33]. Initially, active 10 wt% Ni species were pre-loaded on the surface of Beta zeolite through an impregnation process. Subsequently, the sample was mixed with tetraethylammonium hydroxide solution [34]. The skeleton of Beta zeolite was partially dissolved to oligomers and also generated mesoporous channels connecting the inner part [33,35]. The recrystallization process followed a core-shell mechanism to encapsulate Ni within the zeolite crystal while forming meso-microporous structure ( Fig. 2A). The confinement caused a higher dispersion of Ni nanoparticles as the average particle size of 10Ni@Beta catalyst was reduced to 5.39 nm (Fig. 2B), and in comparison, the impregnated 10Ni/Beta catalyst (Fig. 2C) exhibited lager Ni particles at the surface of Beta zeolite with average size of 16.79 nm. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images indicated a rough exterior surfaces and voids within 10Ni@Beta catalyst (Fig. 2B, Figure S1), caused by the random nucleation and growth of polymorphs during the recrystallization treatment [34,35].",
          "By cutting 10Ni@Beta into slices, the tomographic TEM revealed an internal view of the catalyst, which confirmed the confinement of Ni nanoparticles within the zeolite crystals (Fig. 2D). Besides, the high angle annular dark field STEM and EDS mapping (Fig. 2E, 2F) indicated that the Ni nanoparticles were mainly distributed in the shell and internal mesoporous cavity of 10Ni@Beta catalyst. The linear scan analysis (Fig. 2G) exhibited that Ni content apparently increased from the surface to the inner layer of 10Ni@Beta catalyst, and fluctuated within the Beta zeolite. In contrast, large Ni particles were observed on the surface of 10Ni/Beta catalyst (Fig. 2F and Figure S1), with lower Ni content at the edge and varied in the specific regions of the catalyst (Fig. 2I). Furthermore, the inserted orange circles and arrows in Fig. 2B gave direct observation of interconnecting mesoporous channels and mesoporous structure of 10Ni@Beta catalyst, and they were further confirmed by N2 physisorption analysis (Table S1). It exhibited mixed type I and IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop of 10Ni@Beta catalyst (Fig. 2I), indicating the generation of intracrystalline mesopores with pore distribution of 2–10 nm after dissolution-recrystallization process (Fig. 2J), aligned to the observed TEM morphology. The surface area and pore volume of 10Ni@Beta were both increased compared with 10Ni/Beta catalyst, which could be ascribed to the generation of new mesopores (Table S1). Consequently, surface-cracked LDPE fragments can penetrate the mesoporous channels, avoiding carbon deposition on the surface of 10Ni@Beta catalyst. Moreover, within the mesopores, these fragments are more likely to encounter a higher density of Brønsted acid sites within the mesopores, leading to effective decomposition into smaller molecules.",
          "As indicated by XRD pattern ( Fig. 3A), the structure of 10Ni@Beta catalyst kept almost unchanged after the confinement of 10 wt% Ni species with dissolution-recrystallization treatment. The slight shifted diffraction peaks at 7.9 ° and 22.8 ° to lower angles were due to the small amount of replacement of Si with Ni in the recrystallization process (Figure S2), as Ni was incorporated into the lattice and increased the cell volume of Beta zeolite [33,36,37]. Besides, weak diffraction peaks of NiO and metal Ni in calcined and reduced 10Ni@Beta catalyst strongly indicated the high dispersion state of Ni nanoparticles. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis showed that both 10Ni@Beta and 10Ni/Beta catalysts were predominantly in the metallic state (Fig. 3B). The Ni k-edge XANES spectra of 10Ni@Beta catalyst was a bit closer to the reference of NiO, indicating the presence of positive Ni species. The R-space of Fourier transform of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of calcined 10Ni@Beta sample presented a peak at 1.6 Å (Figure S3), resemble to NiO reference in the first coordination shell. It also showed a peak at 2.8 Å, which was different from the second coordination shell of NiO and could be ascribed to generation of Ni-O-Si bonds during the dissolution-recrystallization process[9,33]. The wide peak of 10Ni@Beta catalyst (Fig. 3C) indicates the presence of Ni-O-Si bonds between Ni metal and Beta zeolite (Fig. 3D), thereby enhancing the interaction between them. The coordination number of the Ni-Ni for 10Ni@Beta catalyst was 5.3, which is notably lower than the 8.3 observed in the 10Ni/Beta catalyst (Table S2), and it also indicated a 0.8 coordination number of Ni-O, mainly due to the existence of Ni-O-Si structure in 10Ni@Beta catalyst.",
          "With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in Fig. 3E, the signal of 10Ni@Beta catalyst was detected only after a certain etching depth (5–10 nm), proving that Ni species were encapsulated in the catalyst. The 10Ni@Beta catalyst was mainly in the metallic state at 853.18 eV, and the partial positive Ni was attributed to the Ni-O bond, in line with XANES analysis. Higher reduction peak at 700 °C of 10Ni@Beta catalyst verified a strong interaction between metal and the support (Fig. 3F), while 10Ni/Beta exhibited a lower reduction peak ranged from 300 to 550 °C. The acidity of the catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD (Fig. 3G), and the desorption temperature of weak acid at 150 °C was slightly shifted to higher temperature for 10Ni@Beta catalyst[23]. Besides, the amount of Brønsted acid sites (the peak at 1545 cm−1 in Fig. 3H) increased in 10Ni@Beta catalyst (Table S3), and the 1H MAS NMR spectra (Figure S4) also confirmed that the chemical shift of Brønsted acidic proton at 3.6–5.2 ppm was strengthened after dissolution-recrystallization [23,38]."

          "The 10Ni@Beta catalyst, featuring an engineered meso-microporous architecture and confined Ni nanoparticles, and it demonstrated an excellent performance in the hydrocracking of LDPE to naphtha. The yield of liquid product was up to 88.0 % ( Fig. 4A), and the selectivity of C5-C9 hydrocarbons reached 99.1 % at 250 °C and 2 h reaction (Figure S5). In comparison, the 10Ni/Beta catalyst and the engineered meso-microporous structured 10Ni/Beta catalyst delivered liquid product yields of only 25.7 % and 74.7 %, respectively at the same condition, mainly due to that Ni nanoparticles covered the Brønsted acid sites on the surface and hindered the cracking process [23]. Remarkably, the 10Ni@Beta catalyst exhibited a slightly higher naphtha yield than the previously reported Pt-based catalysts (Fig. 4B) [3,24–26,39]. It also indicated that the porous 10Ni@Beta catalyst led to the highest naphtha yield of 78.5 % even when the reaction temperature reduced to 200 °C. The enhanced performance of 10Ni@Beta primarily ascribed to the formation of mesoporous structures, which transferred the fragments of LDPE into internal channels of the catalyst for further hydrocracking reaction. Meanwhile, the co-existed microporous structure of 10Ni@Beta played a crucial role in sieving small molecule intermediates that can pass through the micropores, thereby promoting the formation of products with a narrow distribution range. With the synergistic effect of enhanced diffusion by mesopores and product screening by micropores in 10Ni@Beta catalyst, the yield of C5-C9 hydrocarbons was accumulated to 87.2 %, where C6 alkane contributed up to 27 % of the products (Fig. 4A, 4C).",
          "Time dependent experiments indicated that the reaction time (Figure S6) directly affected the degree of LDPE hydrocracking, as the residual amount of solid remained at 40.6 % after 0.5 h reaction, and it rapidly reduced to 0.5 % when the reaction time extended to 2 h. The distribution of hydrocarbons with different carbon number and the selectivity of isomers kept relatively stable with prolonged reaction time (Fig. 4D), indicating the deconstruction of LDPE over 10Ni@Beta followed the same hydrocracking mechanism during the whole process. It was inferred that the LDPE macromolecules were adsorbed on the catalyst surface and gradually degraded until they were transformed into smaller products (Figure S7, S8) [26,40,41]. Fig. 4E showed that 10Ni@Beta favored more gas product at temperature above 250 °C, and the increased long-chain alkanes implied the oligomerization might occur at high temperatures. Besides, it was found that more than 20 % solid residue was remained for the reaction at low pressure (less than 2 MPa) due to the lack of hydrogen (Figure S9), and LDPE was almost consumed with increased pressure at 3 MPa (Fig. 4F). However, more solid residue and long chain alkanes were formed at higher H2 pressures (4–5 MPa), as the stronger competitive adsorption of H on the catalyst reduced the further cleavage of intermediates to smaller products during the reaction [22,42,43].",
          "The yield of liquid product for LDPE hydrocracking was 78 % when reducing the Ni content to 5 wt%, and the product distribution shifted to higher carbon number region (Figure S10, S11). Higher Ni loading led to larger metal particles (Figure S12, S13), and caused a slight increase in the yield of solid residue [9,25,44]. The effect of Beta zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were further investigated following the encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles. These comparisons exhibited similar mesoporous adsorption isotherms and crystal structures (Figure S14, S15). However, the 10Ni@Beta catalyst with Si/Al ratio of 25 indicated relatively more strong acid sites at the desorption peak of 350 °C after the dissolution-recrystallization process (Figure S16), and it resulted in the highest naphtha yield for the hydrocracking of LDPE (Figure S17). Besides, the yield of liquid product remained at 79.6 % when the amount of catalyst was halved to 0.05 g catalyst/2 g LDPE, while the increase of catalyst dosage did not contribute to the further increase of naphtha yield (Figure S18, S19). In addition to the efficient conversion of polyolefins like high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), the 10Ni@Beta catalyst also exhibited remarkable performance in the conversion of real-life plastic waste, including polyethylene (PE) bags and polypropylene (PP) bottles (Fig. 4G, 4H). The yield of liquid product was over 75 %, and it exhibited a similar product selectivity with LDPE conversion (Figure S20, S21). Besides, the strong interaction between metal and support of the encapsulation structure inhibited the aggregation of Ni particles after reaction (Figure S22), and the acidity and the morphology were kept almost unchanged (Figure S23, S24). This catalyst was relative stable for the hydrocracking of LDPE as it delivered high liquid yield and the same product distribution after four times reaction (Fig. 4H, S25)."

          "Further investigation was conducted to reveal the reaction mechanism of LDPE hydrocracking. To isolate the role of Brønsted acid sites, a control experiment for LDPE and Beta zeolite was carried out at 250 °C in N2 atmosphere. The liquid product yield was only 6.6 % and the yield of the unreacted solid remained at 90.4 %. The selectivity of olefins in the liquid product reached 45.9 % (Figure S26), meant that LDPE was deconstructed at Brønsted acid sites to generated small olefins and alkanes intermediates [27]. However, the liquid yield sharply increased to 88.0 % for the hydrocracking of LDPE with 10Ni@Beta catalyst (Fig. 4A), as the encapsulated Ni nanoparticles in Beta zeolite contributed the hydrogenation of olefins intermediates and promoted the whole hydrocracking reaction. Furthermore, the mixture of LDPE and 10Ni@Beta catalyst was heated to 250 °C in N2 using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compared with pure LDPE, the melting point was shifted to lower temperature, meant the initial cracking and decomposition of LDPE (Figure S27). When the temperature was reduced to 180 °C to below the reaction temperature, it showed no change in the melting point (Figure S28). If part of polymer chains diffused into the pores of 10Ni@Beta, it would result in the loss of overall plastic phase transition heat, which reflected by the decreased melting point [45]. The LDPE did not exhibit this behavior, mainly due to its highly branched structure, which hindered its diffusion into the catalyst. However, shorter fragments of LDPE cracking like eicosane (C20H42) confirmed the possibility of intermediates entering the pores of catalyst (Figure S28), as it indicated successive decreases of melting point during 2 cycles. Hence, we proposed that the LDPE chains underwent initial cracking on the Brønsted acid sites to generate intermediate fragment, which entered the pores of the 10Ni@Beta catalyst for further reaction.",
          "To deep explore the high selectivity of C5-C9 hydrocarbons during the reaction, molecular dynamics simulation was used to study the diffusion of different intermediates and reveal the shape-selectivity process. The rates of diffusion within the micropores of Beta zeolite and generated mesopores were calculated (Figure S29, S30), and the slope of mean square displacement (MSD) was used to quantitatively determine the diffusion of normal C5-C20 olefins and their isomers ( Fig. 5A, Table S4). The diffusion coefficient (D s ) of n-C5 and n-C9 in micropores were 1.28 and 0.63 × 10−10 m2/s. For long chain olefins, the diffusion coefficient of n-C11 (0.48 × 10−10 m2/s) and n-C20 (0.1 × 10−10 m2/s) were reduced by 24 % and 75 % compared with n-C9. It meant that the micropores in Beta zeolite favored the diffusion of C5-C9 products, and hindered larger olefin intermediates. In comparation, the D s values of n-C5, n-C11 and C20 olefin in mesopores were 2.22 × 10−10 m2/s, 1.48 × 10−10 m2/s and 0.83 × 10−10 m2/s, respectively. Their diffusion rates were 1.7, 1.9 and 8.3 times higher than those in micropores. The diffusion coefficient of C20 in mesopores was even greater than that of C9 in micropores. Thus, larger olefin intermediates showed a higher diffusion coefficient within the generated mesopores. This elevated diffusion coefficient significantly enhanced their mobility, thereby facilitating their further diffusion within the 10Ni@Beta catalyst [46,47]. Since the metal sites were located inside the Beta zeolite, the intermediate olefins formed at the surface Brønsted acid sites needed to diffuse into the interior to contact with the Ni nanoparticles for hydrogenation. The rapid shipping of intermediate olefins by mesopores effectively prevented surface coking and significantly enhanced the hydrocracking process [26,48]. The olefins and formed alkanes could be further cracked within the mesoporous channels, and C5-C9 hydrocarbons were selectively passed through micropores to generate naphtha product with high selectivity.",
          "The classical mechanism of alkane hydrocracking is initialed by dehydrogenation on the metal sites, and the generated olefins diffuse to Brønsted acid sites and undergoes a series of skeletal rearrangements and C-C bond cleavage reaction to form smaller olefins [26,49]. These desorbed olefins move to the metal sites and are hydrogenated to alkanes, where they could repeat the consecutive reactions. With active metal sites, the steady-state concentration of olefins intermediates could reach a high equilibrium value to displace alkylcarbenium ions through competitive adsorption/desorption [49], thereby reducing the occurrence of severe secondary cracking into gaseous products. The formed positive Ni species from Ni-O-Si bonding in 10Ni@Beta catalyst was identified through charge density difference and Bader charge analysis (Fig. 5B), showing electron transfer from Ni to Beta zeolite. Compared to 10Ni/Beta, the Ni nanoparticles with partial positive charge in 10Ni@Beta catalyst exhibited a more negative energy (-0.83 eV versus −0.48 eV) for the dehydrogenation of intermediates like C20 (Figure S31), promoting its further conversion into smaller products (Figure S32). Besides, the presence of Ni-O-Si bonding affected the coordination environment of Ni in the 10Ni@Beta catalyst [50]. It was found that the liquid yield slightly increased with decreased Ni-Ni coordination number within a certain range (Figure S33), as the positive Ni species facilitated the initial hydrocracking and also hindered deep cracking of C5-C9 hydrocarbons.",
          "During the process of internal diffusion, long-chain fragment underwent different β-scission to produce smaller olefins, and n-C8 olefin was selected as a model molecule to compare the reaction pathways with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The hydrogenation reaction of olefin required the insertion of two H-atoms to form alkane (Figure S34), and the addition of two *H processed with energy barriers of 0.75 eV and 0.66 eV (Fig. 5C, 5D), which was highly active and easily to accomplish at Ni sites [37,48]. The cracking of n-C8 olefin into two olefin molecules on Brønsted acid site (C 8 H 16 →C 3 H 6 +C 5 H 10 , C 8 H 16 →2 C 4 H 8 ) required overcoming energy barriers of 1.78 eV and 2.08 eV, respectively, suggesting that cracking was an unfavorable process, which prevented further deconstruction of olefins into gaseous products (Figure S35). Another possible route was the alkylation reaction, and the thermodynamic energy for the generation of C13 alkane from n-C8 olefin and iso-C5 alkane was up to 1.37 eV, indicating an unfavorable route (Figure S36). Furthermore, experiment confirmed the hydrogenation of n-C8 olefin was easier to occur at 200 °C (Figure S37), as the yield of n-C8 alkane was 67.2 %, the gas product yield was only 2 %, and the ratio of C8 to C4 product reached 56. These data confirmed the hydrogenation process was more favorable during the reaction, effectively preventing the formation of long-chain intermediates that could potentially block the channels, while simultaneously minimizing the production of low-value gaseous byproducts.",
          "It was inferred that more Brønsted acidic sites were exposed at 10Ni@Beta catalyst after the dissolution and recrystallization, which promoted the deconstruction of LDPE into fragments with appropriate size to enter the internal channels. The generated mesopores favored the transfer of large intermediate olefins to Brønsted acid sites for further cracking or hydrogenation reaction at Ni sites, which accelerated the initial cracking of LDPE and avoided surface coking (Fig. 5E). Then the micropores performed the second shape-selectivity based on the length and size of these intermediates, where small olefins (C5-C9) diffused faster, facilitating their preferential access to Ni active sites and subsequent conversion into naphtha with high selectivity. Concurrently, the large molecular intermediates were forced to undergo a secondary cracking at acidic sites and re-entered the micropores for subsequent reactions. Thus, the synergistic effect of the meso-microporous structure with balanced acidity and metals emulated the sequential degradation mechanism characteristic of proteases [47,51]. This, in turn, promoted the cascade hydrocracking of LDPE, and resulted in a narrower distribution of naphtha product over 10Ni@Beta catalyst."

          "The porous 10Ni@Beta catalyst was synthesized with controlled strategy of dissolution-recrystallization, which embedded 10 % Ni loading into the Beta zeolite and generated meso-microporous structure during the process. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that the matched diffusion of large intermediate olefins in mesopore channels and second shape-selectivity of micropores were the key for the narrow product distribution of 10Ni@Beta catalyst. The hydrogenation at Ni sites could hinder the formation of long-chain intermediates to block the internal channels and reduce the generation of gaseous products, thus significantly improve the reaction performance. The 10Ni@Beta catalyst successfully deconstructed polyolefins including low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and their real-life wastes into C5-C9 hydrocarbons, the raw materials for plastic reproduction. The yield of liquid reached 88.0 % and the selectivity of naphtha was over 99.1 % at 250 °C within 2 h reaction, higher than other noble metal catalysts. This catalytic system was also applicable at 200 °C, which achieved a 78.5 % yield of naphtha, demonstrating great industrial potential for polyolefin hydrocracking to close the plastic loop."

    "abstract": "Widespread reliance on fossil fuels and their increasing costs have necessitated the search for viable alternatives. This study details a reliable method for generating jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons (C8-C16) via catalytic pyrolysis of woody biomass. To do this, HZSM-5 was modified using NaOH (N-HZSM-5) and HCl (H-HZSM-5) and utilized in the pyrolysis of three types of sawdust (S1, S2, and S3). In S1 pyrolysis, HZSM-5 increased C8-C16 aromatics’ selectivity despite a lower bio-oil yield compared to the Non-C test. Among sawdust samples, S2 pyrolysis produced the highest C8-C16 aromatics (44.2%) due to its compositional and thermal characteristics. The use of N-HZSM-5 in S2 pyrolysis maximized the yield of bio-oil (46.9 wt%) and the selectivity for C8-C16 aromatics (49.3 %). N-HZSM-5 exhibited stable performance over three cycles, with minimal decline in C8-C16 aromatics.

          "The persistent increase in fossil fuel consumption has resulted in significant economic hurdles and environmental impacts. In particular, the consumption of aviation kerosene, typically used as jet fuel, has increased steadily in recent decades owing to increased transportation needs. This fuel primarily consists of C8–C16 hydrocarbons, with a standard fraction of aromatic compounds such as toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, alongside poly-aromatics like naphthalene and various methylated poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, that are crucial for ensuring the desired energy density, combustion efficiency, and thermal stability of jet fuel (Farooq et al., 2023). The production of jet fuel predominantly depends on petroleum-derived fuels (Zhang et al., 2015), accounting for approximately 8 % of petroleum product usage (Nygren et al., 2009). Therefore, there is an undeniable need for the development of sustainable energy sources for jet fuel production (Chew et al., 2017). Renewable jet fuel (RJF) is a promising alternative that significantly reduces the use of fossil-based jet fuels, making it the most viable and sustainable energy solution for the aviation industry (Jeon et al., 2024). Typically, the selling price of a fuel is determined mainly by capital costs and feedstock prices. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising material for RJF production because of its abundance, non-food characteristics, and cost-effectiveness, with agricultural and forestry industries generating over 180 billion tons of residue annually (Pagano et al., 2023). Importantly, biomass-derived fuels are sulfur-free, CO2-neutral, and renewable, offering the potential to offset the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion (Park et al., 2024).",
          "The Fischer-Tropsch-to-jet and alcohol-to-jet processes are widely used for RJF production; however, the former suffers from high energy consumption, while the latter is limited to carbohydrate-based feedstocks (Jeon et al., 2024). Alternatively, the thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic waste into jet fuel offers an opportunity to address treatment challenges and deliver economic and environmental benefits. In particular, The pyrolysis-to-jet process is simple, controllable, low in emissions, and compatible with existing energy infrastructure (Jeong et al., 2018).",
          "Thermal pyrolysis is cost-effective and eco-friendly, but its bio-oil possesses high viscosity, high water content, reduced thermal stability, and high oxygenated compounds, limiting its direct application as a liquid fuel (Ding et al., 2017). Zeolite-catalyzed pyrolysis efficiently deoxygenates lignocellulosic biomass, yielding high-quality bio-oil (Hernando et al., 2018). In particular, HZSM-5 demonstrates exceptional catalytic efficiency in deoxygenation and jet fuel production via pyrolysis, due to its strong acidity, unique structure, high surface area, and shape-selective catalysis (Gayubo et al., 2004). However, its strong acidity and microporous structure also make it more susceptible to deactivation from intermediate repolymerization and hydrocarbon condensation, while promoting excessive cracking, leading to higher gas production at the expense of liquid aromatics (Hernando et al., 2018; Lesthaeghe et al., 2011). Meanwhile, the high water production in biomass catalytic pyrolysis highlights the need to enhance the hydrothermal stability of HZSM-5 (Kan et al., 2020). Various strategies have been proposed to improve zeolite efficiency, durability, and product selectivity.",
          "The development of hierarchically structured materials with enhanced mesoporosity improves mass transfer, limits polymerization and condensation reactions by reducing diffusion paths, and offers a more homogeneous acid site distribution compared to conventional zeolites (Cui et al., 2016). These properties, along with the improved hydrothermal stability of hierarchical zeolites, help reduce coke formation and enhance the yield of jet fuel aromatics obtained from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (Ding et al., 2017). The preparation of hierarchically structured zeolites primarily involves desilication by alkali treatment, such as with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), or dealumination by acid treatment, such as with hydrochloric acid (HCl) (Chen et al., 2018). Desilication involves disrupting the Si–O–Al bonds in the zeolite structure, selectively extracting Si atoms, and creating mesopores. However, the dealumination process removes Al atoms by cleaving Si–O–Al bonds, creating vacancies that cause adjacent Si atoms to migrate, leaving new vacancies at their original positions (Meng et al., 2020). Following desilication and dealumination, the pore size and volume expand, and the surface acidity of the zeolites is redistributed (Khoshbin & Karimzadeh, 2017). According to the literature (Khoshbin & Karimzadeh, 2017), the introduction of mesopores into HZSM-5 zeolite crystals allows for a change in the surface acidity, greatly improving the catalyst performance and stability. In another study, Meng et al. (2020) observed the successful induction of mesopores along with an increase in the ratio of Lewis acid sites (LAS)-to-Brønsted Lowry acid sites (BAS) in HZSM-5 after dealumination via HCl.",
          "Modified HZSM-5 zeolites have been widely studied for various catalytic processes, due to their tunable acidic properties and the presence of mesoporosity. For instance, Gu et al. (2024) found that alkali-treated HZSM-5 with enhanced mesoporosity promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons in biomass pyrolysis. Similarly, Sim et al. (2024) modified HZSM-5 by reducing BAS via hydrothermal treatment, resulting in coke formation suppression and aromatic compound improvement in methane dehydroaromatization. Li et al. (2024) established the synergetic co-effects of alkali treatment and metal loading on HZSM-5 for enhancing the yield of aromatic compounds in coal pyrolysis. In another study, Chaipornchalerm et al. (2024) reviewed hierarchical zeolites for bioethanol upgrading, emphasizing their advantages in enhancing catalytic performance by optimizing molecular diffusion and acid site distribution.",
          "Most previous studies on modified zeolites have primarily focused on processes such as hydrocracking, bioethanol upgrading, methanol-to-hydrocarbons, and methane dehydroaromatization, while research on the efficiency of these catalysts for jet fuel production through pyrolysis remains largely unexplored. This work advances jet fuel-range hydrocarbons production from woody biomass by overcoming HZSM-5 limitations through alkali and acid treatments. This study specifically examines the effects of desilication and dealumination on enhancing the mesoporosity and adjusting the LAS/BAS ratio of HZSM-5 to improve catalytic performance in sawdust pyrolysis. Notably, a variety of advanced techniques, such as nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), pyridine Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), solid-state 27Al and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were utilized to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the modified catalysts. Additionally, the potential of various types of sawdust to produce jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons was investigated, along with testing the cyclic performance of the best-selected catalyst. Our findings offer valuable insights into enhancing mesoporosity and tailoring the distribution of acid sites to overcome the limitations of traditional HZSM-5, representing a significant advancement in the sustainable production of biojet fuel from lignocellulosic biomass."

          "In the experimental configuration (Fig. 1 ), two sequential steel reactors were surrounded by two heating furnaces. The upper reactor accommodated the feedstock for thermal conversion, followed by catalytic upgrading in the lower reactor. The reactors were fixed using clamps, and a thermocouple was placed inside each reactor to monitor its internal temperature. In a typical catalytic pyrolysis experiment, sawdust and the catalyst were placed in a 3:1 ratio in upper and lower reactors, respectively. During the heating process, a constant N2 flow (50 mL/min) was supplied to purge the reactors, and the upper furnace was held above the upper reactor to ensure that the reaction did not occur before the experiment. The reaction was initiated by lowering the temperature of the upper furnace once the desired temperature (500 °C) was reached in both reactors. The reaction duration was maintained at 30 min for all the experiments. The resulting quenched liquid in the condensers was collected and stored as bio-oil, whereas the pyrolysis gas was collected in a Tedlar bag.",
          "The measurement of the yields of different pyrolytic products (i.e., gas, biochar, bio-oil, and coke), along with the analysis of gas and bio-oil compositions were conducted using the following procedures. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the gas generated during pyrolysis in the feedstock bed flows through the catalyst bed before entering the condenser. The liquid fraction collected in two consecutive condensers connected to the catalyst outlet was identified as bio-oil, while the solid residue remaining after the reaction was considered biochar. The yields of biochar and bio-oil were determined based on the differences in the masses of the feedstock and the condensers before and after the experiment, as calculated using Eq. (1).

The weight difference before and after heating was attributed to the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst. Additionally, the uncondensed gaseous products were collected in a Tedlar bag attached to the outlet of the final condenser. The gas yield was calculated as the remaining mass fraction after subtracting the combined mass of bio-oil, biochar, and coke from 100 %, as expressed in Eq.

          "The physical attributes of the catalysts including BET surface area (SBET) and pore volume, derived from the analysis of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are presented in Table 1 . Enlargement of the total surface area (SBET), pore volume (VTotal), mesopore surface area (SMeso), and pore volume (VMeso) due to desilication and dealumination of the parent HZSM-5 was confirmed. In contrast, N-HZSM-5 and H-HZSM-5 showed slightly lower micropore surface area (SMicro) and micropore pore volume (VMicro) than pristine HZSM-5, which is attributed to the exposure of internal micropores to the external surfaces (Ding et al., 2017). This is a general characteristic of modified zeolites, as reported in previous studies that utilized NaOH (Mochizuki et al., 2012) and HCl (Meng et al., 2020) to treat HZSM-5. The extent of enhancement in SMeso and VMeso was more significant for N-HZSM-5 than for H-HZSM-5. Overall, N-HZSM-5 with higher SBET, VTotal, SMeso, and VMeso than H-HZSM-5 and HZSM-5, was anticipated to exhibit superior performance in sawdust pyrolysis for jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons.",
          "XRF analysis (Table 1) showed a variation in the Si/Al ratio, following the trend H-HZSM-5 > HZSM-5 > N-HZSM-5, reflecting the impact of different treatments on the zeolite structure. NaOH treatment (for N-HZSM-5) promoted desilication, reducing the Si/Al ratio, while HCl treatment (for H-HZSM-5) induced dealumination, extracting Al from the framework and resulting in a higher Si/Al ratio compared to the parent HZSM-5. These results confirm the successful implementation of desilication and dealumination treatments on pristine HZSM-5.",
          "XRD patterns of the HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, and N-HZSM-5 zeolites were obtained (see supplementary material). H-HZSM-5 and N-HZSM-5 exhibited comparably sharper XRD patterns than those of HZSM-5, indicating slight modifications in the MFI-type zeolite structure. This suggests that the framework of MFI zeolite remained intact during Al and Si removal, while increasing its crystallinity.",
          "The acid strengths of the HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, and N-HZSM-5 catalysts were evaluated by NH3-TPD analysis (see supplementary material). The NH3-TPD profiles of all three catalysts demonstrate two desorption peaks at temperature ranges of 100–260 °C and 280–550 °C, respectively related to weak-intermediate and strong acid sites (Chen et al., 2018). The quantified values for these two types of acidic sites are listed in Table 1. A descending trend was observed in total acidity in the sequence of N-HZSM-5 > HZSM-5 > H-HZSM-5, which is reasonable considering the desilication and dealumination treatment mechanisms. Desilication induces a decrease in the Si/Al ratio and a rise in the number of Al sites, consequently increasing the number of acidic sites. However, some acid sites were removed during the dealumination treatment. Accordingly, the chemical treatments modified the distribution of acid sites compared to the parent HZSM-5.",
          "FT-IR measurements using pyridine chemisorption were conducted to investigate the LAS/BAS ratio in the HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, and N-HZSM-5 catalysts (see supplementary material). Chemisorption of pyridine at BAS represented IR bands at around 1,642 cm−1 and 1,547 cm−1, while a peak at approximately 1,450 cm−1 is indicative of pyridine chemisorption at LAS (Mochizuki et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the peak at 1,490 cm−1 corresponded to pyridine interaction with both BAS and LAS (Chang et al., 2015). Modified HZSM-5 catalysts, particularly N-HZSM-5, demonstrated an increase in the LAS/BAS ratio compared to pristine HZSM-5. During desilication, the removal of Si from the HZSM-5 framework reduces the Si/Al ratio, increasing the concentration of Al species that can act as either LAS (from octahedral coordination on the external surfaces) or BAS (from tetrahedral coordination within the structure). Thus, the higher LAS/BAS ratio in N-HZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 indicates a predominant removal of tetrahedrally coordinated Al species within the zeolite framework rather than the removal of octahedrally coordinated Al species from the external surfaces. In the case of dealumination, the removal of Al from the HZSM-5 structure, likely reduces the number of available sites for protons (H+) binding, thereby decreasing the formation of BAS. These observations highlight the modification of acid sites distribution which is consistent with XRF and NH3-TPD analysis.",
          "Detailed information on the change in the zeolite structure, focusing on the connectivity state of silicon oxides, was gathered from 29Si solid-state MAS NMR analysis (see supplementary material). Q3/Q4 of three zeolite samples were obtained by dividing the areas of the Q3 Si to Q4 peaks. The Q3 Si peak corresponds to the defect sites of the silanol group in the zeolite structure, whereas the Q4 Si peak corresponds to the Si tetragonally coordinated internal zeolite structure. Changes in the Q3/Q4 ratio following dealumination or desilication provide evidence supporting the XRD measurements, confirming structural modifications within the zeolite. The increase in the LAS/BAS ratio was also confirmed by 27Al solid-state MAS NMR analysis (see supplementary material). Only tetrahedral Al, which is completely coordinated inside the zeolite structure to hold H+ is considered to play the role of a BAS, while the other species (i.e., pentahedral or octahedral Al) are external defect sites that normally act as LAS. The ratio of aluminum species in pentahedral or octahedral phases to tetrahedral phases (Penta-Octa/Tetra) significantly increased from 0.04 in the parent HZSM-5 to 1.22 after dealumination and 1.17 after desilication, confirming the enhanced LAS/BAS ratio. These findings match the results of XRF, NH3-TPD, and pyridine FT-IR analyses. Alterations in the acid site distribution of HZSM-5 through desilication and dealumination can significantly influence catalyst performance and selectivity during sawdust pyrolysis due to the synergistic co-existence of BAS and LAS (Zhu et al., 2010). The catalytic activity for aromatization reactions is particularly dependent on the LAS/BAS ratio. In this context, N-HZSM-5, which has the highest LAS/BAS ratio, is expected to exhibit better efficiency than H-HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 in generating jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons during sawdust pyrolysis.",
          "The FE-SEM images of all catalysts were provided to examine their surface morphology (see supplementary material). The parent HZSM-5 exhibited a surface structure composed of uniformly compacted cubic crystals with smooth surfaces. In contrast, the FE-SEM images of H-HZSM-5 and N-HZSM-5 revealed distinct surface morphologies due to the removal of Al and Si, respectively. Notably, the structural change was more pronounced in N-HZSM-5, where the external surface of the zeolite underwent partial etching as a result of exposure to NaOH (Deng et al., 2015).",
          "The HR-TEM images of N-HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, and HZSM-5 revealed distinct morphologies (see supplementary material). Notably, both H-HZSM-5 and particularly N-HZSM-5 displayed a disc-like lamellar morphology with a homogeneous surface. This structure enhances catalytic activity by improving accessibility, increasing surface area, and promoting mass transport, thereby contributing to more efficient and selective catalytic processes."

Conversely, the gas yield increased in the catalytic experiment compared to that in the Non-C test, revealing further cracking of the pyrolytic intermediates into gaseous compounds over HZSM-5 (Wang & Song, 2018). Furthermore, gas composition analysis (Fig. 2b) indicated that CO2 and CO were the main constituents of the generated gaseous products, which was in agreement with the previously reported gas composition of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis over HZSM-5 (Zhang et al., 2015). A significant enhancement in CO production was evident in the catalytic experiment, implying stimulated cracking and decarbonylation reactions using HZSM-5 (Wang et al., 2017). A previous study also reported the effectiveness of the HZSM-5 catalyst in decarbonylation. In contrast, the volume percentage of CO2 exhibited the opposite trend, indicating a considerable reduction in the presence of HZSM-5. This suggests that decarboxylation, resulting in the production of CO2, is less favored with HZSM-5, which agrees with the findings of Wang et al. (2014). It was observed that thermally produced oxygenates predominantly underwent decarbonylation instead of decarboxylation, forming reaction intermediates that were subsequently transformed into aromatics using HZSM-5. Therefore, the preferred deoxygenation reaction in Non-C thermal pyrolysis involved decarboxylation, whereas decarbonylation was favored over HZSM-5. Meanwhile, the enhanced content of CH4 and C 2-C4 hydrocarbons in the catalytic test is linked to the intensified cracking of longer hydrocarbon compounds (Hernando et al., 2018) and deoxygenation reactions, specifically decarbonylation, over the BAS and LAS of HZSM-5 (Gao et al., 2017).",
          "The chemical compounds in the bio-oil samples were classified as acids, other oxygenates (i.e., ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and furans), phenols, and C6-C7, and C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons (Fig. 2c). The fractions of acids and other oxygenates in the bio-oil collected from the Non-C pyrolysis of S1 were 41.2 % and 40.8 %, respectively, which markedly decreased to 3.6 % and 15.8 % in the catalytic process using HZSM-5. On the contrary, the proportions of phenols as well as C6-C7 and C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons significantly increased using HZSM-5, reaching 30.8 %, 18.1 %, and 31.7 %, respectively. Furthermore, the use of HZSM-5 enhanced the fraction of aqueous phase in the bio-oil compared to the Non-C case, which is likely due to the abundant BAS promoting dehydration during pyrolysis (Farooq et al., 2023)."

          "To explain the enhanced generation of the desired products (i.e., C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons) and phenols at the expense of acids and other oxygenates over HZSM-5, possible reaction pathways for the catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust are discussed. The pyrolysis of sawdust primarily involves the thermal decomposition of its various constituents, namely, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, at high temperatures, transforming them into volatile compounds. The primary decomposition products of holocellulose (composed of cellulose and hemicellulose) include furans, anhydrosugars, and light oxygenates, such as acids, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols, which are derived from thermal depolymerization and dehydration reactions, whereas the predominant outcomes of lignin depolymerization are alkoxyphenols (Rangel et al., 2023). Accordingly, two different pathways could produce C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons during sawdust pyrolysis: a hydrocarbon pool for holocellulose-derived compounds and a phenolic pool for lignin-derived compounds (Fig. 3 ).",
          "Compared to cellulose, hemicellulose decomposes more readily at lower temperatures due to its branched structure and lower polymerization degree (Eschenbacher et al., 2021). This decomposition involves the thermal breakdown of hemicellulose into xylose or unstable xylosyl cations via glycosidic bond cleavage (Zhou et al., 2018). These cations then undergo further cleavage and dehydration to form furans (e.g., furan, methylfuran, and furfural) and light oxygenates (e.g., acetic acid) (Patwardhan et al., 2011). Decomposition of cellulose begins with the depolymerization of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, forming anhydrosugars (Kuzhiyil et al., 2012). Anhydrosugars, such as levoglucosan, are then produced and interact with the acid sites of the catalyst, facilitating dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation reactions and generating furans, along with light oxygenates (Carlson et al., 2009). All the aforementioned reactions occur on the external surfaces of the zeolites (Wang et al., 2018). Subsequently, the early generated oxygenated compounds can penetrate into the zeolite channels and react at the inner acid sites (Cheng & Huber, 2011). This process leads to the formation of light olefins (C2–C6) (e.g., ethylene, ethylene diene, and propylene) through a sequence of acid-catalyzed cracking, deoxygenation (e.g., dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation), and oligomerization reactions, known as “hydrocarbon pool” mechanism (Gao et al., 2017). In particular, enhanced cracking, dehydration, isomerization, and oligomerization of BAS (Liang et al., 2021) and promoted dehydrogenation of LAS (Farooq et al., 2023) are conducive to olefin production. Subsequently, the C2-C6 olefins obtained from the earlier process can be transformed into C6-C7 aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene and toluene) and C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., xylene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and methylnaphthalene) through a series of hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, Diels–Alder, dehydrogenation, and alkylation (Chen et al., 2018). These reactions can be stimulated over both the BAS and LAS of HZSM-5 via carbonium-ion mechanisms.",
          "The complex crosslinked structure of lignin makes its thermal decomposition challenging. The initial step mainly involves breaking CC bonds rather than CO bonds, generating alkoxyphenols through a radical mechanism (Eschenbacher et al., 2021). Alkoxyphenols can then access the exterior active sites of the zeolite and convert them into phenols and alkylphenols, known as phenolic pools (Chu et al., 2013), alongside oxygen-free aromatic radicals. These alkylphenols then diffuse into the zeolite pores and undergo a series of cracking, deoxygenation (e.g., dehydration, dehydroxylation, and demethoxylation), dealkylation, hydrogen transfer, isomerization, and oligomerization reactions at strong acid sites to form aromatic hydrocarbons (Fan et al., 2018). Additionally, the generated oxygen-free aromatic radicals are inherently unstable and have the potential to combine with hydrogen-rich radicals (e.g., •H and •CH3), leading to the formation of aromatic compounds while liberating gaseous products, mainly H2, CH4, and C2-C4 hydrocarbons as byproducts (To & Resasco, 2015). Coke formation may occur because of lignin polycondensation and phenol repolymerization as competing side reactions (Custodis et al., 2014). Both BAS and LAS are responsible for enhancing the aforementioned reactions, resulting in the transformation of lignin-derived phenolic compounds into aromatic hydrocarbons (Magyarová et al., 2023). For example, increased acidity has been proven to be effective in omitting methoxy (–OCH3) groups, dehydrating aliphatic hydroxyl (–OH) groups, and cleaving aliphatic and ether carbon–carbon (CC) bonds within lignin-derived initial products (Carlson et al., 2011).",
          "Consequently, considering the significant reduction in acids and other oxygenates, along with an enhance in phenols in the bio-oil from catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 compared with the Non-C test, it is speculated that the hydrocarbon pool was the dominant pathway for generating C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons using HZSM-5 in this study. Likewise, Kan et al. (2020) proposed a hydrocarbon pool mechanism for converting light molecules to aromatics within HZSM-5 pores during lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. Although the use of HZSM-5 enhanced the depolymerization of lignin into alkoxy and alkylphenols, their further transformation into aromatic hydrocarbons was limited. This is in agreement with the significant enhancement of the C2-C4 fraction in the gaseous products and the proportion of phenols in the bio-oil obtained using HZSM-5 compared to the Non-C test. Similarly, according to previous studies (Wang et al., 2014), phenolic compounds exhibit significantly lower reactivity toward HZSM-5 than other oxygenates derived from biomass pyrolysis, such as ketones, aldehydes, and acids."

          "Using various sawdust types as feedstock in catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 resulted in similar product distributions; however, notably affecting the proportion of C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil. The biochar yields from the pyrolysis of different sawdust types indicated a minimal difference, which matched their similar proximate analysis and thermal behavior (see supplementary material). The yields of gas and coke were similar for all sawdust types, while the pyrolysis of S3 resulted in a slightly higher bio-oil yield (46.9 wt%) compared to those achieved from the pyrolysis of S2 (43 wt%) and S1 (42.7 wt%). Gas composition analysis showed that the highest amounts of CO and CO2 were produced from the pyrolysis of S3 and S2, respectively. More importantly, the analysis of bio-oil samples indicated that the percentages of acids and other oxygenates were minimized during the pyrolysis of S2, reaching 2.6 % and 6.1 %, respectively. On the other hand, the pyrolysis of S2 afforded the maximum selectivity toward C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons (44.2 %), which was considerably higher than that produced by the pyrolysis of S1 (31.7 %) and S3 (35.1 %).",
          "The difference in C8–C16 aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity among the three sawdust samples can be attributed to their distinct nature, which influences their compositional and thermal characteristics. As shown in the DTG profiles of different sawdust samples (see Supplementary Materials), all three samples exhibit distinct decomposition behavior. While S1 exhibits a more pronounced peak in the α region, likely corresponding to hemicellulose, S3 displays a higher peak in the β region, predominantly associated with cellulose decomposition. Hence, S2 seems to contain a higher lignin content compared to S1 and S3. Furthermore, the slight peak in the γ region suggests a somewhat higher lignin presence, thus improving its potential for aromatic hydrocarbon formation. Thus, S2, an agricultural woody waste, was identified as the most suitable option for producing jet fuel-range hydrocarbons. In agreement with the current study, Părpăriţă et al. (2014) confirmed that agricultural biomass has a greater potential than forest-based biomass to produce aromatic hydrocarbons."

          "Catalytic pyrolysis of S2 using HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, and N-HZSM-5 was carried out at 500 °C to investigate the effects of desilication and dealumination of HZSM-5 on the generation of jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons (C8-C16). Despite the similar yields of biochar in the different experiments, the yields of gas, bio-oil, and coke were considerably different for the different catalysts (Fig. 4 a). About the gas-phase product, HZSM-5 and H-HZSM-5 show quite similar yield (33 wt% versus 34.1 wt%), but N-HZSM-5 resulted in a significant decrease in gas yield (27.7 wt%). Conversely, the bio-oil yield exhibited an opposite trend, with N-HZSM-5 achieving the highest yield at 46.9 wt%. The pore size and acid site distribution of the catalyst had a critical effect on the cracking activity. Thus, N-HZSM-5 with additional mesopores (Table 1) and an enhanced LAS/BAS ratio, as evidenced by the results of pyridine FT-IR and 27Al solid-state MAS NMR analyses, compared to the pristine HZSM-5 and H-HZSM-5, effectively suppressed excessive cracking.",
          "The yield of coke, a key parameter for determining catalyst stability, also differed in the order of N-HZSM-5 (1.2 wt%) < H-HZSM-5 (1.8 wt%) < HZSM-5 (2.8 wt%). When the initial pyrolysis vapors from the biomass interacted with the HZSM-5 catalyst, the bulky oxygenated compounds could not effectively diffuse out of the microporous structure of HZSM-5 (Ahmadpour & Taghizadeh, 2015), causing them to undergo polymerization and carbon deposition on the external surface of the catalyst. Thus, the reduced coke formation on H-HZSM-5, particularly N-HZSM-5, is mainly attributed to the additional mesoporous structure (see Table 1). These factors enhance the diffusion properties of the catalyst and prevent polycondensation of large oxygen-containing compounds (Cheng et al., 2017). Similarly, Mochizuki et al. (2012) observed that NaOH-treated ZSM-5 exhibited a slower deactivation rate than parent ZSM-5 because of the increased number of pore entrances and shorter diffusion path lengths resulting from the introduction of mesopores. In addition to pyrolysis, the positive effect of enhanced mesoporosity on catalytic longevity has generally been observed in various reactions, especially those involving carbonaceous species (Gou et al., 2017). Meanwhile, the increased ratio of LAS/BAS observed in hierarchically structured zeolites, particularly N-HZSM-5, compared to the parent HZSM-5, was also conducive to minimizing coke formation (Farooq et al., 2023). Nearly identical gas compositions were obtained for different catalysts (Fig. 4b).",
          "The analysis of bio-oil samples’ composition (Fig. 4c) showed a minor difference in chemical distribution between bio-oils produced using HZSM-5 and H-HZSM-5, even though the selectivity for C8-C16 hydrocarbons obtained with the latter catalyst (46.4 %) was slightly higher than that produced using the former catalyst (44.2 %). Notably, the use of N-HZSM-5 remarkably altered the chemical composition of the bio-oil produced. In particular, the selectivity for phenols obtained using N-HZSM-5 (24.4 %) was significantly lower than those produced using H-HZSM-5 (31.5 %) and HZSM-5 (35.2 %). Minimization of the acid fraction and enhancement of other oxygenates over N-HZSM-5 were also observed. The increase in the fraction of other oxygenates using N-HZSM-5 (14 %) than those achieved using HZSM-5 (6.6 %) and H-HZSM-5 (5.6 %) was attributed to decreased decarbonylation and dehydration reactions due to the increased LAS/BAS ratio of the catalyst (Kan et al., 2020). More importantly, the selectivity of the desired product (i.e., C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons) was notably enhanced using N-HZSM-5 than those obtained using H-HZSM-5 and HZSM-5, reaching 49.3 %. The water contents of bio-oil samples differed in the order: S2-HZSM-5 (31.4 %) > S2-H-HZSM-5 (29.1 %) > S3-HZSM-5 (27.5 %) > S2-N-HZSM-5 (26.8 %) > S1-HZSM-5 (24.3 %) > S1-Non-C (20.3 %). This indicated that the use of catalysts with enhanced mesoporosity (i.e., N-HZSM-5 and H-HZSM-5) led to a reduction in the aqueous phase within the bio-oil compared to that produced using HZSM-5. This can be linked to reduced LAS/BAS ratio, hence inhibiting the dehydration reaction. The reduced dehydration over NaOH-treated ZSM-5 compared with the parent ZSM-5 was also reported by Hernando et al. (2018) in biomass catalytic pyrolysis.",
          "Considering various criteria of the specification of pyrolysis products, such as bio-oil yield, coke yield, and C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons selectivity, the use of desilicated and dealuminated catalysts, particularly N-HZSM-5, showed enhanced activity, stability, and selectivity toward desired products of this study compared to the parent HZSM-5. These improvements are attributed to the introduction of additional mesopores and the adjusted LAS/BAS ratio in the HZSM-5 structure. Gentle alkali or acid treatment preserved the majority of the micropores, maintaining high catalytic selectivity while simultaneously introducing a moderate quantity of mesopores within the HZSM-5 crystallites. This leads to faster mass transfer by reducing the path length for reactants, intermediates, and products such as C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, the mesopores created within HZSM-5 by HCl and, in particular, NaOH treatment (Table 1) facilitated the access of smaller molecules to acid sites within the micropores, where they underwent conversion into aromatics. Likewise, Li et al. (2014) found that the introduction of mesopores into ZSM-5 zeolites improved their diffusion properties, leading to the enhanced conversion of large oxygenated compounds and increased production of aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, zeolite acidity facilitates cracking and upgrading reactions during biomass processing, and adjustment of the number and strength of acid sites is crucial. A balanced density of BAS and LAS on the catalyst surface are pivotal for effectively cleaving the CC and CO bonds during biomass conversion (Liang et al., 2021). In addition, as previously mentioned, specific reactions during biomass pyrolysis, such as deoxygenation, oligomerization, isomerization, dehydration, and cyclization reactions, are catalyzed by BAS, while dehydrogenation reactions are facilitated by LAS, which is a crucial step in the production of aromatics (Mochizuki et al., 2012). In this context, the synergistic effect arising from the coexistence of both acidic sites enhances the production of aromatic-rich bio-oil (Farooq et al., 2023). Accordingly, the adjusted ratio of LAS/BAS following HCl and NaOH treatments most likely promoted the generation of jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons (C8-C16) in this study. Similarly, it was found that additional Lewis acid sites created by NaOH treatment enhanced the selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste cardboard (Ding et al., 2017).",
          "In summary, among the modified HZSM-5 catalysts, the improved efficiency and durability of N-HZSM-5 compared with those of H-HZSM-5 were associated with the creation of additional mesopores, more effective adjustment of the acid site distribution (i.e., the enhanced ratio of LAS/BAS), and improved crystallinity, as confirmed by the results of N2 adsorption-desorption, pyridine FT-IR, MAS NMR, and XRD analyses.",
          "The positive effects of the introduced mesopores and the tailored acidic properties of HZSM-5 treated with NaOH were also evident in the chemical distribution of the resulting bio-oil. The increased production of C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons and other oxygenates, coupled with a significant decrease in the fraction of phenols using N-HZSM-5, indicated a partial shift in the reaction pathway toward the phenolic pool as the origin of the production of C8-C16 aromatic hydrocarbons. Lignin-derived monomeric phenolic compounds exhibit low reactivity toward HZSM-5 because of their limited diffusion properties (Wang et al., 2014). The introduction of mesopores into HZSM-5 via NaOH treatment likely facilitated the accessibility of complex compounds (e.g., phenolic oligomers) to acidic centers, while allowing jet-fuel aromatic hydrocarbons and coke precursors to more readily diffuse out of the pore channels (Chen et al., 2018). Additionally, it has been found that the kinetic diameter of naphthalene is approximately 0.6 nm (Ruthven & Kaul, 1993), which aligns well with the HZSM-5 pore size (∼0.6 nm, considering Norman radii adjustment (Ding et al., 2017)). However, molecules larger than naphthalene encounter difficulties in exiting the micropores. In this context, the prevalence of alkylated aromatics such as naphthalene, 1-methyl- and naphthalene, 2,6-dimethyl- produced over N-HZSM-5 (see supplementary material) suggests increased accessibility of reaction intermediates to open channels and acid sites resulting from NaOH treatment. The negligible change in the fraction of C6-C7 aromatic hydrocarbons generated over different catalysts aligns with the aforementioned explanations. Moreover, increased acidity has been proven to be effective in removing methoxy (–OCH3) groups, dehydrating aliphatic hydroxyl (–OH) groups, and cleaving aliphatic and ether carbon–carbon (CC) bonds within lignin-derived initial products (Carlson et al., 2011). Hence, the increased overall acidic strength of N-HZSM-5 compared to those of the other two tested catalysts (Table 1) was another conducive criterion for transforming phenolic oligomers into jet-fuel aromatic hydrocarbons. Overall, NaOH treatment of HZSM-5 enabled the catalyst to generate larger hydrocarbons, promoting the production of jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons (C8-C16), highlighting the crucial role of mesoporosity and acidity modifications in optimizing bio-oil composition for biojet fuel production."

          "The durability of N-HZSM-5 was evaluated over three consecutive cycles of S2 pyrolysis at 500 °C. Prior to each cycle, the spent catalyst was regenerated in situ by exposing it to a constant flow of air and N2 at 650 °C for 3 h. Due to the impracticality of analyzing spent catalysts during durability tests, coke amounts were neglected, and the product distribution was normalized accordingly. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the bio-oil yield exhibited a slight decrease in the second cycle but then increased to a maximum of 53.3 wt% in the third cycle. Additionally, CO2 selectivity increased, while C2-C4 hydrocarbon yields declined after each cycle, indicating a shift toward oxygen removal via decarboxylation rather than decarbonylation, which aligns with the slight decrease in CO selectivity after three cycles (Fig. 5b). This trend suggests that mild changes in acidity and pore structure occurred during catalyst regeneration. Fig. 5c illustrates the bio-oil composition across different cycles, where the selectivity of jet fuel-range aromatic hydrocarbons (C8-C16) slightly decreased from 49.17 % to 47.27 % after three cycles. This demonstrates the satisfactory recyclability and stability of N-HZSM-5, attributed to the beneficial effects of hierarchization, which tailored the acid site distribution and introduced mesopores, thereby enhancing the catalyst’s overall durability."

Herein, the hierarchical Ga modified MFI zeolite (GaMFI) anchored bimetallic NiIn catalysts with Ni4In and Ni2In intermetallic compounds (IMCs) were built and employed for hydrodeoxygenation reaction of vanillin to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP). By integrating various characterization data, it was demonstrated that doped In adjusted the acidity and distribution of Ni and Ni-In intermetallic compound (IMC). The NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst achieved an exceptional vanillin conversion of > 99 % and MMP selectivity of > 99 % under experiment conditions of 130 °C, 1.5 MPa H2 and 4 h. Notablely, it exhibited the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 283.8 h−1 among prepared NiIn catalysts, which was related to dispersed Ni and Ni2In IMC dual sites that promoted the adsorption of H2 and vanillin molecules confirmed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, while the abundance of acidic sites facilitated the activation and cleavage of C-O bond. Additionally, the NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst also demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining high activity for at least 5 recycles, and showed outstanding universality for various lignin derivatives. These characteristics highlighted its significant potential in industrial application.",

          "With the continuing consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels on Earth, it is extremely urgent to convert abundant lignin into biofuels [1–3]. Nevertheless, the converted biofuels from lignin typically have high viscosity, low energy density and unstable combustion due to their high oxygen content, thus making them difficult to be directly used [4]. The catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process has been considered as one of the effective routes to upgrade the quality of biofuels owning to significant reduction of oxygen content in lignin molecules [5]. Therefore, designing highly active hydrodeoxygenation catalysts is one of current issues that need to be addressed.",
          "So far, researchers have developed a variety of supported catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation reaction, mainly divided into noble metal catalysts and non-noble metal catalysts [6,7]. Noble metal catalysts have consistently demonstrated superior catalytic activities in hydrodeoxygenation reaction due to their outstanding H2 activation capability [8–10]. However, due to expensive price and limited reserves, the application of noble metal catalysts is restricted in industry to some extent. Compared to noble metal catalysts, non-noble metal catalysts have obvious advantages in terms of economy and reserves [11,12]. Thereby, design of non-noble metal catalysts has gradually attracted the focus of scientists. Fan et al. reported the preparation of Ni/biochar catalysts for vanillin hydrodeoxygenation to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP), and found that the Ni/biochar catalyst with pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C showed a high vanillin conversion (99.9 %) and MMP selectivity (89.4 %) at 170 °C, 2 h and 4 MPa H2 [13]. Wu et al. adopted lignin as carbon carrier to construct Co catalyst with doped nitrogen (Co/CN), meanwhile a 100 % of vanillin conversion and 92 % of MMP selectivity were obtained at 180 °C, 0.5 MPa N2 and 2 h on Co/CN catalyst [14]. In summary, numerous studies have stated that non-noble metal catalysts usually display higher hydrodeoxygenation activity under relatively harsh conditions by contrast with noble metal catalysts. Therefore, designing highly active and inexpensive non-noble metal catalysts remains one of the challenges that researchers face.",
          "Up to now, researchers have made lots of attempts to improve the catalytic activities of non-metallic catalysts, such as preparing metal phosphides, metal nitrides and bimetallic catalysts [15–18]. Among them, bimetallic catalysts have been confirmed superior catalytic activities owning to formation of alloy or intermetallic compound (IMC), thus adjusting electronic and geometric structure [19–22]. Liu et al. prepared NiMo IMC and NiMo alloy for hydrodeoxygenation reaction of furfural, and found that NiMo IMC catalyst exhibited a nearly 100 % conversion and 99 % yield of 2-methylfuran [23]. Han et al. also constructed series NiFe intermetallic compounds for hydrodeoxygenation reaction, and a nearly 100 % yield were realized on Ni7.5Fe2.5 IMC catalyst [24]. It is noted that among various bimetallic catalysts, NiIn catalysts have been extensively investigated due to diverse Ni-In IMCs (Ni4In, Ni3In, Ni2In and NiIn) [25–27]. For example, Wang et al. reported the bimetallic NiIn/SiO2 catalysts with Ni2In, NiIn and Ni2In3 IMCs for selective hydrogenation of methyl esters, and found that the fatty alcohol selectivity of > 94 % was realized on the NiIn IMC catalyst [28]. Bimetallic catalysts are typically prepared with the wet impregnation method [29,30]. However, NiIn catalysts prepared by this method often result in the formation of larger metal nanoparticles, which might affect the structural properties of the catalysts and limit the hydrogenation activity of NiIn catalysts [31]. Consequently, researchers have explored alternative preparation methods to enhance the distribution of Ni and In species in bimetallic NiIn catalysts. Zhang et al. used the in-situ growth method to prepare a core-shell-like bimetallic NiIn catalyst (NiIn@MCM-41) with uniformly dispersed NiIn particles (∼2.76 nm), and found that NiIn@MCM-41 displayed excellent activity for CO2 hydrogenation [32]. Liu et al. prepared MgO-Al2O3 composite material anchored Ni-In IMCs catalysts with various Ni/In atomic ratios by the co-precipitation method for methanol steam reforming [33]. The activity results showed that the methanol conversion of 85 % and H2 selectivity of 97 % were found on Ni2In1/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst with dispersed Ni2In IMC (∼9.5 nm). Horv´ath et al. prepared bimetallic NiIn/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts by the deposition-precipitation method, and found that NiIn catalyst with dispersed nanoparticles (∼5.8 nm) displayed the least coking [34]. In summary, constructing Ni-In IMCs with uniformly dispersed metal nanoparticles has been proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing the activities of Ni-based catalysts.",
          "Additionally, selection of supports is usually a crucial topic in preparation process of supported catalysts. Plenty of materials have been explored and applied for hydrodeoxygenation reaction, such as MOFs, SiO2, CeO2 and zeolites [35–37]. Among these materials, zeolites with superior structural properties, high hydrothermal stability and easy surface modification, have attracted special interests from scientists, moreover numerous studies have confirmed the enormous potential of zeolite catalysts [38–40]. However, the small pore size (< 2 nm) in zeolites partially restricts the macromolecule reactant, so researchers try to create mesopores in zeolites through either alkaline treatment or acid leaching [41,42]. The relevant results demonstrate that introduced mesopores not only accelerate the transfer of macromolecule reactants, but also effectively restrict the growth of metal species, thereby improving their catalytic activities [43,44].",
          "Inspired by the above studies, the bimetallic NiIn/GaMFI catalysts with Ni4In and Ni2In IMCs were fabricated with hydrothermal crystallization and deposition-precipitation method, and displayed excellent catalytic activities for hydrodeoxygenation reaction of vanillin to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP). Alkaline treatment was employed to create mesopores in synthesized GaMFI zeolites. These introduced mesopores could not only restrict the size of Ni and Ni-In IMC nanoparticles, but also promote the transfer of vanillin and hydrodeoxygenation products. Combining with various characterization methods and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the effect of introduced In species on the distribution of Ni-In IMCs, electronic properties and acidity of series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts were investigated in detail."

Then calculated amount of Ga(NO3)3 were added into the solution with stirring at 35 °C for another 4 h. After stirring was finished, the viscous mixture was diverted into Teflon-lined reaction vessel for heating statically at 170 °C for 72 h. Subsequently, the white sample was collected by centrifugation with a speed of 8000 r/min for 5 min, drying at 100 °C for 24 h and calcining at 550 °C for 6 h.",

Subsequently, Na2CO3 solution (0.5 M) was added to the above mixture until the pH of solution reached 8–9. After stirring for 12 h to completely precipitate Ni and In metals, the green samples were collected with centrifugation under the same conditions, drying at 100 °C for 24 h and calcining at 550 °C for 6 h. The bimetallic NiIn/GaMFI catalysts with different In/Ni ratios (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) were noted as Ni/GaMFI, NiIn1/GaMFI, NiIn2/GaMFI and NiIn3/GaMFI, respectively."

Subsequently, 0.05 g of the reduced catalyst, 0.2 g of vanillin and 4.0 g of ethanol were introduced into the autoclave.

          "Wide-angle XRD patterns are employed to analyze MFI structure and distribution of metal species on series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts, and displayed in Fig. 1. It is observed from Fig. 1(A) that Ni/GaMFI and series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts show the typical diffraction peaks corresponding to MFI topological structure at 7–9° and 22–25°, confirming the successful synthesis of MFI zeolite [36,38,45]. From Fig. 1 (B), there are three different crystalline phases presented over Ni/GaMFI and NiIn/GaMFI catalysts, which are Ni (PDF#87–0712), Ni4In (PDF#21–0405) and Ni2In (PDF#42–1033) IMC, respectively. Ni/GaMFI catalyst displays the obvious diffraction peaks attributing to Ni (111) and (200) planes at 44.3° and 51.7° [20,21,23]. When In species are doped, the weak peaks attributing to (110) and (101) planes of Ni4In intermetallic compound (IMC) are observed on NiIn1/GaMFI catalyst. Interesting, the Ni4In IMC transforms into Ni2In IMC with the content of In increasing, which consists with results of other researchers [20,25]. Obviously, a strong peak of Ni2In IMC is presented on NiIn3/GaMFI catalyst with In/Ni molar ratio of 0.3, moreover the peak of Ni (111) plane disappears, indicating the formation of pure Ni2In IMC [27,29,33]. Furthermore, the crystallite sizes of metallic Ni and Ni-In IMC are summarized in Table S1. As displayed in Table S1, the crystallite gradually grows from 5.91 nm to 9.11 nm with the increase of doped In, which is due to the introduced In species causing the expansion of Ni lattice and forming the NiIn IMC [20,28].",
          "The morphologies of GaMFI zeolite and NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst are recorded with SEM spectrum, and the images are provided in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen form Fig. 2 that NiIn2/MFI catalyst shows the morphology similar to GaMFI zeolite, which is composed of relatively uniform particles with the size of 300–500 nm. From Figure S1, it can also be observed that the introduced Ni and In species are well distributed on the GaMFI zeolite. TEM images of Ni/GaMFI and NiIn2/GaMFI catalysts are displayed to observe the morphology and dispersion of metal nanoparticles. It is found from Fig. 3(a) and (c) that the size of GaMFI zeolites is basically within the range of 300–500 nm, which is consistent with SEM results. The TEM images in Fig. 3(b) and (d) display that metal nanoparticles are relatively dispersed over Ni/GaMFI and NiIn2/GaMFI catalysts, moreover the average size of metal nanoparticles on Ni/GaMFI and NiIn2/GaMFI catalysts are 5.79 nm and 6.68 nm. The larger metal nanoparticles on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst might be assigned to the formation of Ni2In IMC by doped In [20,29]. HRTEM image of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst exhibits the lattice fringes of 0.199 nm and 0.206 nm attributing to Ni (111) and Ni2In (110). Combining the EDS mapping in Fig. 3(f), it confirms the presence of mixed Ni and Ni2In phases in NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, which accords with results in XRD characterization.",
          "Various NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are measured with N2 adsorption-desorption technique to obtain the pore structural data, and presented in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 (A), designed Ni/GaMFI and NiIn/GaMFI catalysts present characteristic Type-IV isothermals within the P/Po values of 0.45–0.95, corresponding to mesoporous channel [36,38,46]. The pore distribution of various NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are supplied in Fig. 4 (B), and NiIn/GaMFI catalysts present the relatively concentrated pore distribution. Additionally, the detailed structural data of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are provided in Table S1. It is found from Table S1 that specific surface area of series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts decreases from 247.5 to 209.1 m2/g with the increase of In species, which might result from the doped In occupying the partial surface of NiIn/GaMFI catalyst [26,28]. Obviously, NiIn/GaMFI catalysts display the high pore size (about 5.7–6.8 nm) and volume, favoring the sufficient contact between vanillin molecules and active centers, moreover the rapid transfer of hydrodeoxygenation products within the channels.",
          "NiIn/GaMFI series catalysts are tested with XPS spectrum to analyze the chemical valence and electronic properies of metal species. The XPS analysis of Ni 2p of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are supplied in Fig. 5(A), and the broad “Satellite-state” peak located at about 861.1 eV indicates that partial Ni species still exist in the form of oxides after hydrogen reduction. Meanwhile the obvious peaks appearing at about 852.3 and 855.9 eV correspond to Ni0 and Ni2+ species [47,48], and it is found that the binding energy of Ni0 on series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts shifts toward lower binding energy from 852.3 eV to 852.0 eV with doped In species increasing, indicating that the electron transfer occurs between Ni and In metals in NiIn IMCs, thus forming “electron-rich” Ni species of NiIn IMCs [28,29,49]. The Ni 2p results also consist with previous XRD observations, furthmore proving the formation of NiIn IMCs. The detailed XPS data of Ni 2p are supplied in Table 1, and from Table 1, the proportion of Ni0 of series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts conforms the order: NiIn2/GaMFI (43.9 %) > NiIn3/GaMFI (40.3 %) > NiIn1/GaMFI (37.6 %) > Ni/GaMFI (34.9 %). It is well known that M0 (M=Ni, Co and Cu) is regarded as the active sites to dissociate H2 molecules on non-noble catalysts [22,46]. Thus, more Ni0 species of NiIn2/GaMFI are conductive to the hydrodeoxygenation reaction of vanillin. XPS result of In 3d of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5(B), and the peaks attributed to In0 and In3+ species are observed at about 443.2 and 450.8 eV, 444.8 and 452.4 eV [50,51], respectively. It is obviously seen from Fig. 5(B) and Table 1 that In3+ is the main formation of doped In species on series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts, moreover the binding energy of In on NiIn/GaMFI catalysts shifts toward higher binding energy, which further confirms the electronic interaction between In and Ni species in Ni2In IMC [28].",
          "Series of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts are characterized with NH3-TPD technique to measure the amount of acid sites. From Fig. 6 (A), the desorption peaks found at 100–300 °C, 300–500 °C and 500–700 °C correspond to weak, medium and strong acid sites [45,52]. Two desorption peaks are observed on Ni/GaMFI catalyst at 100–300 °C and 500–700 °C, indicating the existence of weak and strong acid sites. Compared to monometallic Ni/GaMFI catalyst, the strong acid sites of bimetallic NiIn/GaMFI catalysts decrease as the In/Ni molar ratio increases, while the moderate acid sites enhance. It is remarkable from Table S2 that the total acid sites of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts increase with the addition of In, demonstrating that the In introduction enhances the acidity of bimetallic NiIn catalysts, which accords for the conclusions of other researchers [27,33]. Obviously, the maximum quantity of moderate acid sites is found on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, which is beneficial to the activation and breakage of C-O bond in lignin molecules [53,54]. However, the total acid and medium strong acid content of NiIn3/GaMFI catalyst decrease by contrast with NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, which might be due to the introduction of excessive In leading to the larger crystallite [55].",
          "H2-TPR technique is employed to investigate the interaction and reduction properties of oxidative NiIn/GaMFI catalysts, and displayed in Fig. 6 (B). From Fig. 6 (B), a shoulder H2 consumption peak at 550–650 °C is found on Ni/GaMFI catalyst, which is assigned to the reduction of NiO species [28]. The high temperature reduction peaks demonstrate the strong interaction between Ni species and GaMFI support [49]. After the In species is introduced to Ni/GaMFI catalyst, the reduction peaks gradually shift towards lower temperatures with the increase of In/Ni molar ratio. Clearly, a sharp reduction signal is observed at about 475 °C on NiIn3/GaMFI catalyst. These results indicate that the introduction of In to form Ni-In IMC is beneficial for weakening the interaction between Ni species and GaMFI zeolite, thus promoting the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0 [25,27]. Additionally, based on Table S1, the NiIn/GaMFI catalysts exhibit a smaller hydrogen consumption similar to Ni/GaMFI catalyst, which is attributed to the dispersed metal nanoparticles."

          "The performance of series NiIn/GaMFI catalysts for vanillin (VAL) hydrodeoxygenation is evaluated, and activity data are listed in Table 2. It is found that only 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) and vanillyl alcohol (HMP) are detected in the hydrodeoxygenation products. Vanillin can not be converted unless a catalyst is inputed. When monometallic Ni/GaMFI catalyst is used for vanillin reaction, a vanillin conversion of > 99 % and MMP selectivity (61.8 %) are found without In addition, which is related with its few acid sites and Ni0 species based on NH3-TPD and XPS results. With the increase of In/Ni molar ratio, the hydrodeoxygenation activities of NiIn/GaMFI catalysts enhance gradually, and it is evident that NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst displays the highest MMP selectivity (>99 %) by contrast with other NiIn/GaMFI catalysts. Considering the above charaterization data, the superior activity of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst is ascribed to the dispersed Ni and Ni2In IMC dual sites for H2 activation and vanillin adsorption, while well distributed acidity favors the hydroxymethyl deprotonation, thus promoting the vanillin hydrodeoxygenation. Nevertheless, as the doped In further increases, the selectivity of MMP on NiIn3/GaMFI catalyst decreases, which is due to the weaker interaction that forms larger Ni2In IMC crystallites. Meanwhile, the reduced Ni0 species and acid sites also affect H2 activation and the breakage of C-O bond in lignin molecules. Referring to Table S3, the NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst exhibits the most impressive turnover frequency (TOF) value of 283.8 h−1, which is nearly 2 times that of Ni/GaMFI catalyst. The highest TOF value of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst is attributed to the introduction of suitable In species, which not only generates dispersed Ni and Ni2In IMC sites, but also increases the acid sites and Ni0 species of the catalyst, thus improving the hydrodeoxygenation activity.",
          "Given the superior activity of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, the effect of different reaction conditions on MMP selectivity and vanillin conversion has been thoroughly studied to clarify hydrodeoxygenation process, and corresponding data are presented in Fig. 7. It is found from Fig. 7(a) that vanillin is almost completely converted at low temperature, and remains basically consistent with reaction temperature changing from 110 to 140 °C. In contrast, selectivity of MMP is less than 60 % at 110 °C on the NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, and as the reaction temperature rises to 130 °C, a > 99 % selectivity of MMP is realized on the NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst. This result illustrates that the C-O bond is highly sensitive to reaction temperature, and high reaction temperature favors the generation of MMP. However, as the reaction temperature further raises, the selectivity of MMP remains unchanged, and no other products are found. Hence, 130 °C is considered as the optimal reaction temperature.",
          "Activity data of different hydrogen pressures on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst are presented in Fig. 7(b). It is found from Fig. 7(b) that the selectivity of MMP changes from about 50 % to > 99 % with hydrogen pressure enhancing from 0.5 to 1.5 MPa. Although the reaction pressure is further increased, selectivity of MMP remains almost consistent. Thus, the optimal reaction pressure on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst is selected as 1.5 MPa. Hydrodeoxygenation activities of differen reaction times on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst are provided in Fig. 7(c). Interestingly, vanillin is almost completely converted with the reaction time of 0.5 h, and HMP is the main detected product, accounting for about 64 %. In contrast, MMP selectivity is very low, only accounting for about 36 %. The HMP selectivity begins to decrease with the reaction continuing, while MMP selectivity increases gradually. Significantly, a > 99 % MMP selectivity is observed after vanillin reaction lasts for 4 h. Afterwards, by continuing to extend the reaction time, MMP selectivity remains basically consistent. In brief, the optimal reaction time on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst is considered as 4 h.",
          "The recycling measurement of NiIn2/GaMFI vatalyst is conducted with the reaction condition of 130 °C, 1.5 MPa and 4 h. It is notable from Fig. 7(d) that no obviously decrease of MMP selectivity and vanillin conversion are observed after 5 cyecles, proving the strong stability of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst. Furhtermore, various lignin-derived molecules are employed to verify the versatility of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, and activity data are supplied in Table 3. It is concluded from Table 3 that diverse substrate molecules are efficiently converted (>99 %) with high selectivity (>90 %) under the testing conditions. Nevertheless, it is seen that 2-Bromobenzaldehyde is hardly converted on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, which might result from the presence of electron-withdrawing group being detrimental to hydrodeoxygenation reaction. In short, the activity data in Table 3 fully prove the excellent universality of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst."

          "In order to figure out the H2 activation/dissociation and reactant adsorption behaviors on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst, DFT calculations are conducted with the simplified models of Ni (111) and Ni2In (110) active sites, and the adsorption energies of vanillin, HMP and H2 molecules are presented in Fig. 8. It is seen from Fig. 8 (a1) and (b1) that adsorption energies of H2 molecule on Ni (111) and Ni2In (110) are −0.178 eV and −0.079 eV, indicating that H2 molecule tends to dissociate into active hydrogen species on Ni (111) site. Meanwhile the adsorption energies of vanillin are −0.093 eV and −2.037 eV on Ni (111) and Ni2In (110) sites, proving that formation of Ni2In (110) sites enhances adsorption capacity of reactant vanillin. Additionally, it is obvious that Ni2In (110) sites show higher adsorption energy of HMP than Ni (111) sites, supporting that Ni2In sites are more conductive to break the C-O bond in HMP molecule and generate the target MMP. Based on above discussion results, a possible synergetic reaction network of vanillin hydrodeoxygenation has been proposed in Fig. 9: firstly, H2 molecules are adsorbed on Ni sites for decomposition into active H atoms; vanillin molecules are adsorbed and activated on Ni2In sites, and conducted a rapid reaction with overflowing H atoms from Ni sites to generate intermediate vanilla alcohol. Afterwards, with the action of acid sites, vanilla alcohol conducts further hydrogenolysis step to crack C-O bond and form objective product MMP. Eventually, objective product MMP conducts timely desorption step on the NiIn2/GaMFI catalysts to achieve the whole hydrodeoxygenation process."

          "The hierarchical GaMFI zeolite supported bimetallic NiIn catalysts with Ni4In and Ni2In IMCs were fabricated through hydrothermal crystallization and deposition-precipitation method. It was found that the introduction of In species enhanced the acid sites and promoted the formation of Ni-In IMCs. An excellent hydrodeoxygenation activity of lignin derivatives was realized on NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst under mild conditions, which was attributed to the synergetic effect of dispersed Ni and Ni2In sites, more acid sites and Ni0 species. The successful development of NiIn2/GaMFI catalyst demonstrates the unique advantages of bimetallic synergy and zeolite supports for lignin hydrodeoxygenation, providing significant guidance for designing non-noble metal catalysts for the processing of complex biomass molecules. This study emphasizes the importance of DFT calculations in guiding experimental design. By combining DFT calculations with experiments, it can gain a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and enable precise catalyst design. This research model will play an increasing important role in catalyst development."

          "Most global energy systems rely on fossil fuels, which, despite their benefits, pose significant problems such as environmental damage, scarcity, supply risks, and price instability. As non-renewable resources, their long-term availability is uncertain, and thus, more sustainable solutions for the production of fuels and chemicals have to be found [1]. In this context, biomass can be distinguished as the only current sustainable source of organic carbon for the chemical industry [2,3]. Biomass consists mainly of lignocellulosic and related materials (70–75 % of biomass), oils and fatty acids (15–20 % of biomass) and proteins (less than 5 % of biomass) [4]. Among them, lignocellulose and vegetable oils have attracted interest during the last decades due to their broad worldwide availability and their potential for producing renewable fuels and chemicals [5]. The three main components of lignocellulosic biomass are lignin (15–20 %), hemicellulose (25–35 %) and cellulose (40–50 %) [6,7]. Lignin is a 3-D macromolecule consisting mainly of three phenolic building units: sinaphyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol. These monomers are linked via C-O and C-C bonds, thus creating highly complex methoxylated phenylpropanoid units [8,9]. After its isolation from the other biomass components, lignin can be used for the production of polymers, such as epoxy resins, or be converted into valuable chemicals such as phenolics, aromatics or carbon materials (e.g., biochar) [10–13]. In the plant structure, lignin surrounds hemicellulose and cellulose, providing rigidity and resistance [14]. Hemicellulose polymer consists of pentoses (xylose, arabinose), hexoses (mannose, glucose, galactose), and sugar acids [15,16]. Likewise, hemicellulose can be used either directly in the production of materials (films, coatings, medical biodegradable materials, etc.) or be converted in a wide range of important chemicals such as xylitol, ethanol, furfural (FUR), 5-hydromethoxyfurfural (HMF) and more [17,18]. Cellulose is a crystalline polymer of glucose units linked by the β-glycosidic bonds, the structural modifications of which can lead to valuable products ranging from biomedical to electronics, as well as coatings, and textiles [19,20]. Important compounds, such as HMF can be derived also from glucose, that are further converted to a plethora of high value chemicals such as formic acid (FA), levulinic acid (LA), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), as well as C7-C15 alkanes after aldol condensation and hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation [21].",
          "Vegetable oils (VOs) are historically one of the most important renewable feedstocks of the chemical industry as they are biodegradable, have low ecotoxicity and high availability. From VOs such as sunflower, soybean, castor, and palm oils, a wide range of fuels and materials can be produced [22–26]. VOs consist mainly of triglycerides, which are esters composed of a glycerol part and three fatty acids. Fatty acids can be saturated (e.g., palmitic acid, stearic acid), monounsaturated (e.g., oleic acid, palmitoleic acid) or polyunsaturated (e.g., linoleic acid, linolenic acid) [27,28]. Glycerol, obtained from the transesterification process or the hydrolysis of VOs, can be used for the production of biofuels (e.g., hydrogen and syngas, ethanol and methanol), fuel additives and polymer precursors (e.g., olefins, acrolein, propanediols) [29]. Fatty acids can also be valorized through various processes such as hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, transesterification, metathesis, epoxidation, pyrolysis to industrially important materials such as lubricants, biofuels, bio-composites, and chemicals [30–37]. The use of catalysts is crucial for these reactions as well as for lignocellulose conversion. Catalysts can improve reaction rates and product selectivity and are classified into three main categories: enzymes, homogeneous and heterogeneous. Compared to the other two categories, heterogeneous catalysts have attracted the interest for industrial applications due to their chemical and thermal stability as well as easy separation from the reactant/product mixture and recyclability [38–40]. However, biomass catalytic valorization in presence of heterogeneous catalysts is accompanied from some challenges. Firstly, biomass is chemically diverse, often containing oxygen-rich functional groups that require selective transformations [41–43]. Low selectivity is often an issue with undesired side reactions, e.g., over-oxidation or epoxy hydrolysis, leading to low yields of target products [44,45]. Another challenge is that biomass may also contain impurities, like ash or metals, which complicate the catalytic processes. These impurities, together with other byproducts (e.g., water, acids, coke) can deactivate catalysts [46,47]. In addition, often encountered issue is the bulkiness of biomass molecules (e.g., lignin-derived oligomers) which struggle to access active sites in microporous catalysts [48]. Addressing these issues through efficient catalyst development may make biomass a viable resource for commodity and fine chemicals that could compete with current fossil-based strategies.",
          "One of the most important classes of heterogenous catalysts that are widely used in industry is zeolites. Generally, zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials, with porous structure, high surface area, acidic-basic surface properties and high thermal stability that have found application in catalysis, adsorption-separation, and ion exchange [49–51]. Their unique properties make them highly effective in overcoming many challenges associated with biomass conversion. An overview of the role of zeolites in biomass valorization reactions is presented in Fig. 1. Significant progress has been made in recent years to develop novel zeolite catalysts with tailored characteristics, such as hierarchical porosity for enhanced accessibility, precise control over acid site properties (including concentration, type, and strength), the creation of basic sites, and the incorporation of guest metals to produce multifunctional materials. Compared to other supports, such as metal oxides and carbonaceous materials, zeolites have well-defined pore structures that enable size-selective catalysis – a crucial advantage when upgrading biomass-derived molecules with varying sizes. [52]. Moreover, their acid/basic properties can also promote reactions (e.g. dehydration, isomerization) in situ, whereas other supports often require additional acid/base additives [53,54]. This surface chemistry of zeolites is also beneficial for metal deposition, as their stable structure and strong binding of active sites generally lead to less metal leaching and thus lower deactivation rates [55].",
          "Numerous reviews are published, highlighting the role of zeolites in producing biofuels and bio-based chemicals [56–59]. While some reviews cover the entire scope of this field, others focus on specific aspects, such as the use of zeolites to catalyze lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis [60,61], bio-oil and phenolics upgrading through deoxygenation and catalytic cracking [62–64] as well as the conversion of specific biomass derived compounds to targeted products (e.g., glucose to furans or HMF production) [65,66]. Among the catalytic processes used for biomass upgrading, oxidative transformations for producing acids and epoxides have gained significant interest, as these chemicals can act as building blocks for a renewable chemical and polymer industry. To the best of our knowledge, despite the numerous review articles related to zeolite-catalyzed reactions for biomass upgrading, oxidative transformations are barely discussed.",
          "This review article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the role of zeolites in a representative range of biomass valorization reactions, with particular focus on the oxidative transformations via greener and more sustainable pathways. Specifically, our main focus is to review oxidative reactions (oxidation of functional groups, epoxidation of double bonds, and oxidative C–C bond cleavage) in the context of biomass, more broadly defined. By covering various feedstocks (sugars, platform chemicals like HMF, lignin-derived aromatics, fatty acids/oils), we want to provide a unified view of how zeolites perform in oxidation reactions across biomass sub-fields. The article begins by examining the zeolite core properties, which often influence the types of reactions which they can effectively catalyze. Following this, a concise overview of biomass transformations involving zeolite catalysts, emphasizing oxidative processes is presented. The focus is centered on the oxidative reactions of specific functional groups and bonds, highlighting the distinctive zeolite properties and active sites required for these reactions. The intrinsic microporosity of the zeolites, while beneficial for many catalytic processes, can also pose limitations, particularly when it comes to the diffusion of large bio-molecules. To address this challenge, a discussion about the use of hierarchically structured zeolites, which feature secondary porosity (mesopores), as a potential strategy for enhancing active sites accessibility is also delivered. Through this overview, we aim to elucidate the relationship between the chemistry of various oxidative transformations and the specific properties required for effective zeolite-based catalysts. The review concludes with a discussion of current challenges and future perspectives."

          "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials typically consisting of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra linked by bridging oxygen atoms, forming secondary building units (SBUs). The SBUs, as shown in Fig. 2, are then organized in more complex structures (e.g., sodalite cages, hexagonal prisms) and finally create 3D frameworks [67–69]. Zeolite frameworks exhibit different sizes, shapes, and connectivity of channels, with pore sizes can range from 0.30 to 0.45 nm for eight-membered ring pores, to 0.8 nm for 12 or 14-membered ring pores [70,71]. Zeolites framework topologies have been classified by the International Zeolite Association (IZA), with a unique three-letter code for each topology [72]. Among the most widely used zeolites in the chemical and petrochemical industries are ZSM-5 (MFI topology), zeolites Y and X (FAU topology), Mordenite (MOR topology), Beta (BEA topology), Chabazite (CHA topology), and Ferrierite (FER topology) [73]. Most of them have been used for the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process as well as other reactions such as phenol hydroxylation, ethylbenzene alkylation and olefin epoxidation [74–76]. For the FFC process primarily USY zeolite is used, with this application constituting more than 95 % of the overall zeolite catalyst consumption worldwide. Propylene epoxidation towards propylene oxide formation is also an important process by BASF-Dow joint venture, which employs a zeolite of framework structure type MWW, modified with Ti and Zn, and is established for many years now. For industrial applications, zeolites are selected based on their specific characteristics regarding the structure, the morphology and the composition as well as the needs or limitations of the reaction [75].",
          "While some zeolites occur naturally, most of the technical-grade zeolites are synthesized through methods such as hydrothermal synthesis (the most common approach), solvothermal synthesis in non-aqueous solvent medium, ionothermal synthesis in the absence of solvent, or microwave assisted conventional method [77]. In the zeolite framework, the replacement of the Si4 + cation in the tetrahedral position by Al3+ results in an excess of negative charge, which is usually compensated by inorganic cations or protons (e.g., Na+, K+, Mg2+, NH4+, H+). When protons act as compensating cations, a hydroxyl group is formed between Si and Al atoms, Si-(OH)-Al, which catalytically behave as Brønsted acid site (BAS). For zeolites with a high Si/Al ratio, the thermal stability and hydrophobicity of zeolite structure tend to increase, while low-silicon zeolites are more hydrophilic and have increased ion exchange capacity [78,79]. In addition to Brønsted acid sites, zeolites are also characterized by Lewis acidity. Lewis acid sites (LAS) can be generated through the post-synthesis modifications such as steaming, calcination at high temperature, and acid or base leaching. These treatments lead to the hydrolysis of the framework Si-O-Al bonds, partial removal of aluminum, and the formation of ‘extra-framework aluminum’ (EFAl) species [80,81]. Alternatively, LAS can be generated by isomorphous substitution, where Al atoms in the zeolite framework are replaced by other tetravalent or pentavalent metal atoms, such as titanium, tin, zirconium, iron, vanadium and more [55,82,83]. These modifications enhance the catalytic properties of zeolites, broadening their applicability in various reactions."

          "As already mentioned, in the zeolite framework Al atoms can be replaced with other metals via isomorphous substitution without any change in the topological structure, thus leading to the formation of metal-containing zeolite frameworks. The metals are fully coordinated with framework oxygen, forming Si-O-Metal linkages, and/or partially dislodged containing both framework Si-O-Metal linkages and terminal Metal-OH groups. The most common procedure for the preparation of metal-containing zeolites is by adding metal salts or metal organics to the synthesis gel during the hydrothermal procedure. Other methods include the dry-gel conversion (DGC), demetalation−metalation and inter-zeolite transformation [55]. One of the most well-known metal modified frameworks is that of TS-1 catalyst (titanium-silicalite-1), with incorporated titanium into the pure silica MFI framework, which poses unique properties especially for oxidation reactions [84–86].",
          "Except for framework metal species, extra-framework metal species that exist adjacent to the zeolite framework are also important for the catalytic transformations. These metallic sites are located on the zeolite’s channels, or pores, due to electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, or chemical interactions between the metal sites and the framework. They can be in the form of metal single sites, metal clusters or nanoparticles [87–90]. Many transition metals, such as Cu, Co, and Fe can be introduced to the zeolite surface via ion-exchange and provide well-defined acidic and redox active sites [91–93]. Noble metals are also often supported on zeolites, providing valuable catalytic activity for a range of reactions, e.g., oxidation of volatile compounds on Pt/ZSM-5 [94]. For noble metals, due to their scarcity and high cost, the creation of highly dispersed metal active sites is very important as it can reduce the required metal amount while maintaining a high catalytic activity. Noble metal cations such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and have been successfully introduced into the extra-framework positions of zeolites, presenting great catalytic activity in isomerization, oxidation, hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions [95–99]. Metal clusters, consisting of a few atoms, are confined within zeolite crystals in channels, cages, or intersectional voids, while metal nanoparticles (NPs), with larger sizes, are usually located either on the external surface of the zeolite or close to positions where there are structural defects [100]. Compared to other supports, zeolites are particularly effective at stabilizing metal nanoparticles, preventing leaching and sintering [101]. In Fig. 3, a schematic representation of the location of metal species in framework and extra-framework positions is provided. There are varying methods for the synthesis of zeolite-supported metals, with impregnation (dry or wet), ion-exchange and deposition-precipitation being the most commonly used [52]."

        "content": [
          "In the conversion of large substrates, mass transport limitations can negatively impact the reaction rate, as the majority of active metal sites in conventional zeolites are confined within their microporous (< 2 nm) structures [102]. For zeolites with larger crystal sizes in the micrometer range, the contribution of the external surface and the associated active sites is usually minimal. Decreasing the crystal size (e.g., zeolite nanocrystals of ≤200 nm) increases the share of the external surface area, which can improve both the catalytic activity and catalyst lifetime [103]. However, controlling the crystal size remains challenging, and separating small zeolite crystals from the reaction mixture by filtration is difficult due to their colloidal properties. To enhance accessibility to the active sites and reduce steric hindrance, alternative strategies include the synthesis of zeolitic materials that feature mesopores in addition to their typical micropores [104,105]. A schematic representation of the main hierarchical zeolite structures compared to conventional microporous zeolites is displayed in Fig. 4. Hierarchical zeolites have already found application in industrially relevant reactions such as: alcohol dehydration, catalytic cracking, benzene alkylation, methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) and olefin hydro-isomerization [106–113].",
          "Hierarchical zeolites can be prepared according to various synthesis procedures, with the most common methods being soft templating, hard templating, zeolitization of mesoporous silicates (e.g., MCM-41, SBA-15), desilication and dealumination [114]. In templating-based methods, hierarchy is created during the synthesis process by using templating materials that promote the formation of larger pores. Then the material is calcined at high temperatures in air to remove the template, leaving only the zeolitic framework. In soft templating, surfactants or block co-polymers are typically used to guide the formation of mesopores [115–117]. Hard templating involves the use of various types of carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers to create the desired porous structure [118–122]. Less common templates are metal nanocrystals or nanoparticles [123,124], as well as other macro-templates, such as bacterial threads, natural sponges, and leaves of plants [125–127], offering an alternative route for hierarchical zeolite fabrication.",
          "Mesoporous structures with amorphous walls, such as SBA-15 and MCM-41, can be transformed into crystalline zeolitic structures through a process known as zeolitization. This approach allows for the preparation of zeolite structures with intercrystalline mesopores, which can improve the accessibility of active sites and enhance catalytic performance. Two main procedures are typically used to achieve the crystallization: vapor phase transport (VPT) and steam assisted conversion (SAC). In VPT, both water and a structure-directing agent (SDA) are vaporized and interact with the initial material, promoting zeolite crystallization. In contrast, the SAC method involves only water in the liquid phase, while the SDA is contained in solid gel phase, guiding the formation of the zeolitic structure [128].",
          "Another strategy to enhance the porosity of zeolite materials is through demetalation, a method that introduces additional porosity by selectively removing metal atoms from zeolite’s framework. This can be achieved through dealumination or desilication procedures. Dealumination is a post-synthesis method that removes aluminum from the zeolite structure and can be achieved by steaming, acid leaching (e.g., HNO3, H2SO4, HCl or organic acids) or other chemical treatments [129,130]. While dealumination increases porosity, it can also affect the acidic properties of zeolite, often leading to a decrease in surface acidity due to the Al framework extraction [131]. Desilication is defined as the extraction of silicon by using an alkaline medium [132–134]. This technique has been known to yield lower Si/Al ratios with only small changes in framework acidity. Extraction of silicon atoms leads to a significant amount of extra porosity, which starts in the boundaries or defect sites of the zeolite crystals and preserve the structural integrity. The formed mesopores are interconnected, enhancing their accessibility from the external surface of zeolite and improving mass transport properties [130].",
          "Two -dimensional zeolites, composed of thin nanosheet layers up to 3 nm in thickness, have also attracted the interest as catalytic materials that can mitigate diffusion limitations. They can self-assemble into various hierarchical structures, including disordered unilamellar assemblies, ordered multilamellar stack or pillared frameworks [135,136]. These two-dimensional zeolites offer significant advantages in terms of accessibility to active sites and catalytic performance due to their unique structural characteristics. There are varying methods for the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets, with the most common being crystallization from unique organic structural directing agents [135], additive-assisted synthesis with the use of organic and inorganic compounds (e.g., urea and fluorinated surfactants) [137], seed-directed synthesis [138] and exfoliation of layered zeolites precursors by post-synthesis treatment [139]."

          "Over the last years, the use of zeolitic materials in biomass valorization reactions has gained increased attention, especially due to zeolite’s special features such as shape-selectivity, acidity and thermal stability [140,141]. According to the existing literature summarized in Table 1, modified zeolites have been employed in various important reactions, including glucose isomerization-dehydration, LA hydrogenation, sugars esterification, aldol condensation, and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO).",
          "One of the most important transformations in biomass valorization is the conversion of glucose to HMF and LA, which are important platform molecules for biopolymer synthesis. The process typically involves a multi-step reaction, starting with glucose isomerization to fructose, followed by fructose dehydration. While glucose isomerization to fructose was conventionally catalyzed by enzymes, the use of heterogeneous catalysts offers advantages such as milder reaction conditions and catalyst reusability [142–144]. Tin-containing zeolites, particularly Sn-Beta, have shown great activity for glucose isomerization to fructose due to their Lewis acidity [145,146]. Framework Sn sites, incorporated as tetrahedral (or T-) atoms in the zeolite framework, are considered catalytically the more active [147], and can be easily created via the solid-state incorporation of Sn into Beta zeolites [148,149]. When Brønsted acidity is present due to Al atoms in the zeolite framework, the further dehydration of fructose to HMF can be achieved. Brønsted acidic sites are known for their dehydration activity over also other alcohols and ketones [150,151]. According to Zhang et al. [152], Sn-Al-Beta catalyst with both Sn and Al framework species showed high HMF yield (54 %) which was stable after 5 cycles and catalyst regeneration. Sn-Beta zeolites have been found also effective to catalyze the cycloaddition of isoprene and methyl acrylate for the production of bio-derived monomers [149]. Zeolites with surface metal species, such as those containing Cr, Fe, or Hf, have been found active for glucose and cellulose conversion to HMF [153–156]. From the same reaction path LA can be produced after the hydrolytic ring opening of HMF [157], or directly from the hydrolysis reaction of furfuryl alcohol or xylose. Zeolites with low Si/Al ratio, such as HZSM-5, have shown high activity for LA production, comparable or even better than that of the homogeneous sulfuric acid, with much better recyclability potential [158,159].",
          "Metal modified zeolites have also been used in biomass hydrogenation reactions [160,161]. One important example is LA conversion to GVL (γ-valerolactone), a value-added platform chemical for the production of biofuels, fuel additives, and polymers [162]. Ruthenium and nickel supported zeolites have shown good activity during LA hydrogenation to GVL at temperatures ranging from 100 to 220 °C under H2 atmosphere [163,164]. Zeolite acidity can facilitate the dehydration step of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid, which is formed after LA hydrogenation and is the main intermediate in GVL synthesis. The beneficial role of acid sites of zeolites was evident in LA hydrogenation at 100 °C, where Ru/HZSM-5 presented much higher GVL yield compared to RuO2 deposited on carbon-based supports [163]. Zirconium supported zeolites have been used for FUR transformation to GVL, employing alcohols as hydrogen donors under N2 atmosphere, with excellent results at temperatures between 150 and 180 °C [165,166]. As it was revealed, ZrP-modified H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed almost complete FUR conversion and over 90 % GVL yield in the first run. However, the catalyst activity was decreased after four runs due to the formation of carbon deposits, which easily blocked the zeolite micropores and obstructed access to active sites [166].",
          "Esterification reactions are important for the production of chemicals and biofuels from biomass-derived molecules [167,168]. For example, methyl levulinate, a fuel additive that is used in the food, polymer and pharmaceutical industries, can be produced from the reaction of sugars with methanol [169]. According to Li et al. [170], the hybrid zirconia-modified zeolite HY (ZrY6), which possesses both acid and basic sites, could effectively convert a range of sugars including glucose, mannose, galactose and sucrose to methyl levulinate at 180 °C. Compared to ZrO2, which promotes isomerization of glucose to fructose through its basic sites, the acidity provided by HY support could facilitate the subsequent dehydration, esterification and rehydration reactions. Under similar reaction conditions, the moderate acidity of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) based zeolite zirconia composites enhanced ethyl levulinate synthesis from furfuryl alcohol, resulting in much higher conversion and product yield compared to t-ZrO2 [171]. SAPO-type zeolites, while important in other biomass conversions (e.g. hydrodeoxygenation), have seen little application in oxidative biomass valorization. From the esterification reaction of fatty acids green biodiesel is produced [172]. Zeolites H-Y and ZSM-5 have been successfully utilized for linoleic acid and palmitic acid esterification with methanol, at 60–180 °C, presenting almost complete conversion and high product yield (∼70–80 %) even after 5 catalytic cycles. Here, pore size and the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance were critical for the efficient product formation [173,174]. It was shown that the use of HZSM-5–50 resulted in very low conversion (lower than 10 %), which was slightly improved in the case of H-ZSM-5–30 and H-Y-5.2 (20–27 % conversion). The H-Y-60 catalyst, with higher average pore size, large cavities and more hydrophobic surface, showed full conversion (100 %) [173].",
          "Aldol condensation of aldehydes and ketones is another important reaction for producing biofuels. While homogeneous sodium hydroxide aqueous solutions are very effective for aldol condensation [175], zeolites with both acidic and basic properties have been successfully used as alternatives [176,177]. Kubička and co-workers [178], tested different structural types, including H-ZSM-5, H-BEA, H-MOR and H-USY, for the condensation of FUR with acetone. Among these, H-BEA owning a wide pore, three-dimensional crystalline framework, exhibited the best catalytic performance producing high amounts of condensation products after 2 h reaction at 100 °C. Unlike materials with basic character that result in the formation of only the first condensation C8 product, FAc, Brønsted acid sites of H-BEA contributed to the formation of also the second condensation C8 product, (Fac)2, due to the dimerization of the olefinic FAc on the acid sites.",
          "Finally, zeolites have presented great performance in HDO reactions, which are crucial for upgrading pyrolysis oils and fatty acids. Pyrolysis oils, derived from lignocellulose pyrolysis at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen, contain a mixture of phenolic compounds, alkoxy-aromatics and monolignols, with high water content that limit their use in the production of fuels [179]. The utilization of zeolites in the step of pyrolysis can enhance the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons [180]. Appropriate zeolite topology and acidity can promote the formation of bio-oils enriched in monoaromatic compounds, without further condensation into PAHs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) [181]. However, due to the low organic fraction of bio-oils and rapid catalyst deactivation, ex-situ upgrading of the pyrolysis oils is often preferred. Metals such as nickel, iron, palladium supported on acidic materials have shown great catalytic activity in HDO reaction of biomass derived oils [182–185]. Especially nickel modified zeolites showed impressive results in phenolics HDO, resulting in high deoxygenation degree and cyclohexane/methyl-cyclohexane selectivity [185,186]. The Ni-ITQ-2 composite achieved 99 % yield of methylcyclohexane from m-cresol (a lignin-derived phenolic). Additionally, zeolite acid-base sites can catalyze the isomerization of long-chain alkanes produced during fatty acid HDO, leading to the formation of iso-alkanes, which are valuable components in second-generation biodiesel production [187–189]."

          "During the recent years, oxidative reactions of biomass have attracted the interest as important pathways for producing valuable intermediates used in the food, chemical and polymer industries. As presented in Fig. 5, oxidative transformations of biomass derived molecules can be broadly divided into three main categories: i) oxidation of functional groups, ii) epoxidation of carbon-carbon double (CC) bonds, and iii) oxidative cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds.",
          "Regarding the oxidation of functional groups, much of the focus has been on glucose and HMF. Both these molecules contain -OH and -CHO groups that can be oxidized towards carboxyl (-COOH) groups. From glucose oxidation, important organic acids such as gluconic acid (GOA), glucuronic acid (GUA) and glucaric acid (GAA) can be produced. Especially GOA has found extensive application as food additive, in pharmaceuticals and polymers, and as cement additive in construction industries. Following the conventional practice, GOA and GAA can be produced by biochemical oxidation using fungi, bacteria, enzymes or chemically by using nitric acid. However, these strategies suffer from low productivity, lack of catalyst recyclability and environmental pollution [190]. In the polymer industry, HMF oxidation to FDCA has opened new opportunities for the production of bio-based polymers, as FDCA is an important substitute for a variety of petrochemicals, such as terephthalic and adipic acid [191,192]. In addition to FDCA, HMF can be partially oxidized to DFF, an important intermediate for the synthesis of ligands, pesticide, antifungal agents, fluorescent materials and polymeric materials [193,194].",
          "Regarding the epoxidation of fatty acids, which are the major component of VOs, they contain CC bonds that can be epoxidized towards derivatives used in the production of polymers, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and lubricants. Bio-based polyols and polyurethanes can be produced from the epoxidation of fatty acids or directly from VOs [195,196]. The reaction was conventionally conducted with the use of percarboxylic acids, such as peracetic or performic acid, which can be formed in situ from hydrogen peroxide and the corresponding acid in the presence of a strong mineral acid. However, this process has many disadvantages, including low epoxide selectivity due to competing ring-opening reactions, the formation of strongly corrosive by-products, and the production of unstable and explosive peracids [197].",
          "In addition to epoxidation, fatty acids can be subjected to oxidative cleavage of CC bonds, which leads to the production of a wide range of useful bio-based mono-and di-carboxylic acids. Similar to FDCA, these acids are considered as renewable, carbon-neutral monomers for polymers production [198,199]. The direct oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozone-based methods pose significant concerns due to the risk of explosive reactions, which have been previously reported [200].",
          "Given the challenges and opportunities in these transformations, the production of biomass-derived acids and epoxidized monomers represents a pivotal area of ongoing research. The use of environmentally friendly solvents (e.g., water), “green” oxidants (e.g., O2 or aqueous solutions of peroxides) along with catalysts with stable activity and easy recyclability, is crucial for developing more sustainable technologies to the chemical industry. Zeolites, with their unique structural and chemical properties, have already found extensive use in a variety of industrial catalytic processes, and they offer significant advantages for the oxidative biomass transformations. Advances in zeolite synthesis and post-synthesis modifications enable the design of materials with tailored pore sizes, morphologies, and compositions, with tunable acidity that can be used for oxidative reactions opening the path for the establishment of new eco-friendly processes for acids and epoxides production."

          "The catalyst preparation method was found to have an impact on glucose oxidation under base-free aerobic conditions as demonstrated by Wolska et al. [205], who explored the impact of different synthesis methods for gold-supported zeolites. They found that deposition method can affect gold loading, particle size and the support acidity. The highest glucose conversion (91 %) and GOA selectivity (99 %) were achieved with a 2 % Au-HBeta(AP) catalyst prepared by anchoring gold species onto (3­aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS).This method produced small and very homogeneously distributed gold nanoparticles (∼ 6 nm). In contrast, the ion-exchange method, resulting in larger nanoparticles (15–30 nm) in the Au-HBeta(IE) catalyst, allowed the simultaneous adsorption of glucose and oxygen to gold particles, thus increasing the reaction rate ( Fig. 6a). According to the proposed reaction mechanism (Fig. 6b), in the base-free oxidation, BAS can facilitate the initial glucose adsorption through the carbonyl oxygen and the protonation of the aldehyde group, emphasizing the role of BAS in the zeolite supports. This leads to the formation of a geminal diol, for which one of its -OH groups can be oxidized with the adsorbed oxygen activated on Au NPs, thus forming GOA. Catalyst stability tests showed that 2 % Au-HBeta(AP) preserved high conversion (over 75 %) and 100 % gluconic acid selectivity even after 6 catalytic cycles. The doping of Au-Beta zeolites with a second metal (Nb or Ce) presented interesting results as niobium dopant, despite acting as a structural promoter for better gold dispersion, decreased the activity of the catalyst. This result could be attributed to the very strong gold-niobium interaction that resulted in a decrease of both conversion and GOA selectivity. On the other hand, cerium nanoparticles in neighboring positions regarding gold nanoparticles probably increased the number of total active sites, and thus had a positive influence on the conversion and GOA selectivity.",
          "Another approach for glucose oxidation towards the corresponding acids is photocatalysis [206,207]. Photocatalytic conversion is considered as a promising technology for producing chemicals from biomass as the reaction is driven by solar energy, at low temperatures, atmospheric pressures, using non-toxic and low-cost catalysts [208,209]. Heterogeneous photocatalysts are mainly semiconductor materials, such as metal oxides, which are active in presence of UV or visible light [210]. Metallothioporphyrzines (MPz) have also been used in selective organic transformations due to their distinct optical and electronic properties [211,212]. The deposition of FePz(SBu)8 complex on H-ZSM-5 resulted in a highly active photocatalyst for glucose oxidation under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) in water. The large specific surface area and high chemical stability provided by the zeolitic support was proved beneficial as FePz(SBu)8/H-ZSM-5 achieved glucose conversion of 35.8 %, compared to the unsupported FePz(SBu)8 that had only 4.9 % conversion [212]. Other photocatalysts, such as TiO2, have also been explored for glucose oxidation [213,214]. According to Colmenares et al. [215], the use of a TiO2 supported zeolite Y catalyst, prepared by a modified sol-gel method assisted by ultrasonic irradiation, showed high GAA-GOA selectivity (68.1 %) during glucose photooxidation in a water-acetonitrile system at 30 °C. The negatively charged framework of zeolite Y and its high surface area helped to facilitate the selective photocatalytic oxidation of glucose, compared to the bulk TiO2. Under similar reaction conditions, the use of chromium-dopped TiO2/zeolite Y catalyst, prepared via the improved wet impregnation-ultrasonic irradiation method, resulted in only 7 % glucose conversion, however, carboxylic acid selectivity increased to 87 % [216].",
          "The complete oxidation of HMF to FDCA is usually conducted in presence of noble metal catalysts supported on oxides or carbon materials in basic conditions [217–219]. Similar as in glucose oxidation, a decrease of the additional base is required. According to the findings of Liao et al. [54], complete aerobic oxidation of HMF and 98 % FDCA yield were achieved, at 140 °C, with the use of 1 %Au/Sn-Beta, prepared using the sol-immobilization method. LAS generated by the incorporation of Sn4+ ions into the framework of Beta, facilitated the initial HMF adsorption via the -CHO group and the breakage of O-H bond of hydroxyl group, resulting in increased FDCA formation. The presence of both Au and Sn led to higher FDCA yield (46.7 %) compared to Au/Beta and Sn-Beta separately, suggesting a synergistic effect between Au particles and zeolite framework Sn4+ ions. Indeed, the versatility of introducing various metals (e.g., Sn, Mg, Cu) within the zeolite framework allows for tuning its acidic/basic sites, thereby improving the efficiency of additional metal active sites (e.g., Au). A comparison with other similar works that use Au supported on carbon materials and oxides, showed that Au/Sn-Beta provided higher FDCA productivity (millimoles of FDCA produced hourly per gram of noble metals), despite the lower amount of additional base that was used. Stability tests were performed with the 2 %Au/Sn-Beta, for which HMF conversion was maintained at 95–100 % even after 4 catalytic cycles, indicating a relatively stable activity for these catalysts. High HMF conversion and product selectivity were also achieved in the case of magnesium modified zeolites. According to Zhu et al. [220], the basic sites of 2 %Au/Mg-zeolites (Beta, MOR, FAU), promoted HMF oxidation under base-free conditions, achieving 98.1 % FDCA selectivity at 130 °C. The Mg2+ ions substituted into the zeolitic framework can provide the basic sites that facilitate HMF oxidation through the high HMF adsorption, even under base-free conditions [53]. Other noble metals, such as platinum and ruthenium supported on zeolites, have shown remarkable activity in HMF oxidation to FDCA [221–223]. Despite the low metal content (0.2 %), platinum nanoparticles encapsulated in the framework of Beta zeolite (0.2 %Pt@Beta) presented near-complete HMF oxidation at 90 °C in presence of O2, resulting in 99 % FDCA yield. When comparing Pt@Beta with Pt/C, despite the > 99 % HMF conversion in both cases, the carbon supported catalyst showed a FDCA yield decrease to 32 %. This dramatic difference highlights how zeolite’s confined environment suppresses over-oxidation or side reactions on Pt, whereas carbon allows unselective pathways. Additionally, the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within zeolite Beta framework enhanced the stability of the active sites, as rare deactivation was observed after a five-run test [221].",
          "An alternative way for FDCA production is the electrochemical HMF oxidation [224,225], which usually operates at room temperature and in absence of additional oxidants, as the reaction is driven by the electric potential [226,227]. Tantisriyanurak et al. [228], reported a hybrid NiAl-MOR-CNTs catalyst for HMF oxidation, leading to complete substrate conversion and 92 % FDCA selectivity. The prepared electrode, composed of the synthesized catalyst and a Nafion binder, preserved the high catalytic activity even after several experimental cycles. MOR zeolite was used as support for the homogeneous dispersion of NiAl-LDH, forming a composite that was then calcined to produce highly dispersed metal oxides.",
          "For the partial HMF oxidation to DFF, vanadium supported zeolites have been found to selectively oxidize only the hydroxyl group of HMF, leaving the aldehyde group intact to form DFF [229,230]. A high silica MOR zeolite with isolated vanadium species was used for the aerobic oxidation of fructose, at 120–130 °C, giving 100 % fructose conversion and 96.0 % DFF yield in the presence of HCl [230]. The isolated tetrahedral [V2O8]6− species, deposited on zeolites surface, presented high activity in the oxidation of HMF to DFF and resistance to the overoxidation of fructose. The high-silica MOR framework provided satisfactory acidity for the formation of the intermediate HMF and preserved the zeolite structure under acidic conditions. Reusability tests showed that V2O5@MOR catalysts with Si/Al ratio 60 maintained a DFF yield over 90 % even after 5 catalytic tests, with preserving both the crystallinity as well as porous and morphological features. In contrast, for catalysts with low Si/Al, Al and V leaching was observed, decreasing thus DFF yield to 78.8 % after the 5 cycles. In the direct HMF aerobic oxidation to DFF at 120 °C, the use of V2O5/Cu−MOR zeolite exhibited high DFF yield (91.5 %) with 99 % conversion [231]. HMF was adsorbed on the catalyst surface and was then oxidized to DFF mainly by lattice oxygen (V5+-O2-). Due to the presence of O2, the lattice oxygen vacancies of V4+ transition active site could be re-oxidized to regenerate V5+-O2- species. According to the authors, the strong interaction between the framework Cu species with the vanadium atoms on the zeolite´s surface promoted both the activity and the stability of the supported V active sites, resulting in a good catalyst reusability. Contrary to the V2O5@MOR for which HMF conversion was decreased from 99 % to 75.4 % and DFF yield from 63.4 % to 25.8 % after 5 cycles, V2O5@Cu-MOR maintained a conversion of 99 % and a DFF yield higher than 80 %. This improvement is due to the robust and well-defined pore system of zeolite supports that stabilize metals incorporated into their framework, assuring a high dispersion of active species, i.e. V5+-O2-. In Fig. 7a schematic representation of the two pathways for HMF oxidation towards DFF and FDCA over zeolite-based catalysts is presented.",
          "The selective oxidation of the aldehyde group of HMF can lead to the formation of hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), an important compound for the synthesis of furanic polyesters [232,233]. Niobium modified zeolites with surface metal oxides (MOx@Nb-zeolite, where MOx = CoOx, MnOx or FeOx, and zeolite = USY and Beta) demonstrated great catalytic behavior in the oxidation of HMF to HMFCA, at 170 °C in presence of t-BuOOH. The catalysts, prepared via the dealumination of zeolites H-USY and H-BEA followed by impregnation with niobium ethoxide, resulted in acid-base properties and led to complete HMF conversion with 97.0 % HMFCA selectivity [233].",
          "In summary, the selective oxidation of glucose and HMF using zeolite-supported noble metals has proven to be a highly efficient and sustainable method for producing valuable bio-based chemicals such as GOA, FDCA, and DFF. The development of base-free conditions, as well as alternative methods such as photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation, has opened new avenues for greener and more efficient biomass valorization routes. The use of zeolites as catalyst supports in these reactions offers significant advantages, including tunable acidity, high surface area, and the potential for easy catalyst recycling. In Table 2, a summary of the zeolite catalyzed oxidation reactions of glucose and HMF towards the corresponding acids is presented."

          "The conventional industrial process for the epoxidation of double bonds involves the use of highly acidic media that have many drawbacks, such as low selectivity towards the targeted epoxides, hazards associated with highly concentrated peroxides and corrosiveness issues. The use of heterogeneous catalysts based on W and Ti have shown great potential as alternatives, offering high product yields and/or selectivity under mild conditions [234–236]. In the early 1980s, EniChem's discovery of TS-1 zeolite enabled the development of a new approach for the selective epoxidation of propylene. This method was using H2O2 as oxidizing agent with water being as the main byproduct, making it a more environmentally friendly alternative [237,238]. Among solid epoxidation catalysts, those based on titanium and silica are the most extensively studied as they provide a favorable balance between effective catalytic performance under mild conditions, low cost and reusability potentials due to the relatively stable Ti-O-Si bonds against leaching [234].",
          "TS-1 catalysts have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in epoxidation reactions. Wilde et al. [239], reported that the industrial TS-1 catalyst achieved methyl oleate (MO) epoxidation to epoxidized methyl oleate (EMO) with a selectivity of 87 % at 93 % conversion after 24 hours at 50 °C. Compared to other titanium-containing catalysts, such as TiOx-SiO2 and Ti-MCM-41, the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti species in TS-1 zeolite promoted H2O2 activation, thus forming Ti-OOH active sites, which could epoxidize effectively the carbon-carbon double bonds. After three catalytic runs conversion was steadily decreased while the epoxide selectivity slightly increased. However, the initial activity and selectivity of the catalyst were completely recovered by calcining TS-1 at 400 °C for 24 hours. In the same work, TS-1 was also used for the epoxidation of biodiesel (mixture of methyl oleate, methyl linolate and methyl linolenate) derived from rapeseed oil, achieving 90 % conversion with 76 % selectivity. Here it was found that TS-1 with crystallite sizes in the sub-micrometer scale and with stacked morphology exhibited a significantly higher turnover number than the industrial TS-1.",
          "The influence of Si/Ti ratio of TS-1 on the epoxidation effectiveness is significant. TS-1 catalysts with Si/Ti ratios ranging from 40 to 80 were hydrothermally synthesized and tested for the epoxidation reaction of soybean oil (SO) at 60 °C [240]. Among the catalysts, TS-1–40 (Si/Ti ratio of 40) demonstrated the best performance, with 40.9 % conversion and 88.2 % selectivity towards epoxidized soybean oil (ESO). The higher amount of framework titanium species in TS-1–40 improved reactant conversion and epoxy-product formation. Although the TiO2 catalysts also presented high catalytic activity, they showed severe decomposition of H2O2, limiting their use in industrial applications. Additionally, TS-1–40 showed excellent reusability after high-temperature calcination, making it a viable candidate for scaling up clean, acid-free epoxidation processes for ESO production.",
          "Apart from the epoxidation of carbon double bonds of biomass derived molecules, zeolites can also be used for the hydrolysis of epoxides to vicinal diols [244]. Vicinal diols produced from the direct ring-opening of epoxides are widely used as intermediates in the production of polymers, cosmetics, medicines, and more [245]. While the direct dihydroxylation of double bonds to vicinal diols is possible, it typically involves the use of harmful reagents such as OsO4. As a result, an indirect two-step process – comprising double bond epoxidation followed by epoxy hydrolysis – has gained attention as a more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative [246]. This approach employs heterogeneous catalysts and diluted oxidants, such as aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide in low concentrations, making it both safer and more efficient. The inherent acidic functionalities of epoxidation catalysts, combined with the water content in the oxidant allow the two-step reaction to be carried in out in a one-pot process [247]. Ring-opening reactions are commonly catalyzed using strong acids or Lewis acids in the presence of alcohols, which act as nucleophiles [248,249]. Modified zeolites featuring Lewis acidity offer a promising catalytic system, as these materials combine high activity for epoxy hydrolysis with benefits such as recyclability, stability and process safety. Zeolites incorporating metals such as tin, titanium, hafnium, and zirconium have shown remarkable catalytic activity in epoxide hydrolysis to vicinal diols [245]. Their activity stems from the tailored acidity of the incorporated metal sites, which effectively activate the epoxide ring while maintaining the advantages of a heterogeneous catalytic system."

          "The conventional oxidative cleavage of CC double bonds was typically conducted in presence of ozone, which, while effective, possess environmental and safety concerns. To mitigate these issues, alternative oxidants such as H2O2 and O2 are more desirable, offering a safer and more sustainable approach to cleaving fatty acid CC bonds [250]. Among these methods, the most relevant follows a three-step mechanism: i) double bond epoxidation, ii) epoxide hydrolysis to yield vicinal diols, and iii) oxidative vicinal diol cleavage [251–253]. While modified zeolites have been successfully employed for the first two steps, their application in vicinal diol cleavage remains limited. Homogeneous catalysts based on Fe, W, Co and Ru have been the primary focus of research for this step [254–259]. Recent studies, however, highlight the potential of metal supported catalysts for achieving efficient C-C bond cleavage.",
          "Ethylene glycol (EG), the simplest biomass-derived vicinal diol, serves as a key feedstock for producing formic acid (FA), an important substance for the chemical, agricultural, textile, leather and pharmaceutical industries [260]. In the oxidative cleavage of EG with H2O2 at 50 °C, the use of 0.5 %Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst resulted in 100 % EG conversion and 47.7 % FA selectivity [261]. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies showed monomeric Fe3+ sites are the most active for C–C cleavage, whereas Fe-oxide clusters are far less active. The zeolite stabilizes these isolated Fe sites and the confinement may also orient diol molecules for selective C–C scission to acids. This structure–function relationship (isolated vs clustered metal sites) dramatically affects efficiency and selectivity. Lower catalytic activities were observed in the case of 0.5 %Fe/BEA and 0.5 %Fe/MOR, likely due to their bigger 12-membered ring pores, compared to 10-membered ring pores in ZSM-5, facilitating the formation of undesired FeOx aggregates which suppressed EG conversion. Even lower EG conversion (lower than 5 %) was obtained with the use of 0.5Fe/SiO2 and 0.5Fe/Al2O3 catalysts, fact that further underly the need of structured microporous environment in zeolites. Under mild reaction conditions, 0.5 %Fe/ZSM-5 could also convert larger molecules, such as glycerol (86 % conversion, 48 % FA selectivity), glucose (49 % conversion, 18 % FA selectivity) and sorbitol (36 % conversion, 25 % FA selectivity). In these cases, the decreased catalytic activity of Fe/ZSM-5 could be attributed to the lower accessibility of the larger molecules to the active Fe-sites inside the zeolite micropores. The combination of Fe/ZSM-5 with TS-1 has shown promise for the direct ethylene oxidation to FA [262]. As shown in Fig. 9, in presence of H2O2, TS-1 catalyze the epoxidation of CC bonds, while Fe/ZSM-5 provide the desired acidity for the epoxide hydrolysis and Fe active sites for the vicinal diol cleavage.",
          "Mesoporous materials can be a promising strategy for the conversion of large molecules during oxidative cleavage, where diffusion limitations in microporous zeolites are a major challenge. In 1992 a new family of mesoporous silicate and aluminosilicate materials referred as M41S was designated by researchers at Mobil [263]. One of the most extensively investigated members of this family of materials is MCM-41, featuring one-dimensional hexagonal arrangement of uniform mesopores of 0.2–10 nm. This material resembles a zeolite with respect to its regular system of pores with uniform width, however, one significant difference is the non-crystallinity of the silica or silica–alumina pore walls in MCM-41 [264]. In the oxidative cleavage of methyl-epoxy-stearate at 60 °C in presence of H2O2, the addition of Al-MCM-41 to WO3·H2O significantly improved catalyst reusability [265]. While WO3·H2O alone resulted in 90 % conversion with 80 % selectivity for nonanal and methyl 9-oxonanoate, combining it with Al-MCM-41 increased conversion to 99 % with aldehydes selectivity of 65 %, maintaining performance over four cycles. The impregnation of tungsten species to the surface of MCM-41 further enhanced catalytic activity, achieving 99 % conversion and 78 % methyl 9-oxononanoate selectivity [266]. Compared to other previous works, here the catalyst presented excellent catalytic activity for 4 cycles, with no soluble tungsten species being detected in the liquid medium. The use of Cr/MCM-41 in the oxidative cleavage of oleic acid at 80 °C with supercritical carbon dioxide resulted in 99 % conversion, producing pelargonic acid and azelaic acid with concentrations of 31.7 % and 32.0 %, respectively [267]. Although Co/MCM-41 and Mn/MCM-41 maintained similar conversions, their selectivity for targeted acids was lower, and these catalysts showed greater susceptibility towards leaching.",
          "The single carbon bond (C-C bond) cleavage is also a challenge in the valorization of lignin derived molecules. Compared to the relatively high reactivity of C-O bonds, the selective cleavage of C-C bonds is more difficult because of their non-polar nature, high robustness and bond dissociation energies [268]. However, oxidative techniques using metal-loaded zeolites have shown promise. These methods not only break C-C bonds but also yield highly functionalized oxygenates like aldehydes, ketones and organic acids [269]. Bio-derived vanillin, a very important intermediate for the synthesis of polymers [270], can be produced from the selective oxidation of isoeugenol [271–274]. Sahu et al. [275], reported a 19 % isoeugenol conversion and 70 % vanillin selectivity using only H2O2 at 60 °C. Introducing cerium into MCM-22 (Ce-MCM-22) improved isoeugenol conversion to 61 %, by keeping stable vanillin selectivity (73 %). The use of bulk CeO2 showed only 24 % conversion with various product distribution. The two independent 2-dimensional channel systems accessible by ten-membered ring pores of MCM-22 (MWW framework type) facilitated the dispersion of Ce active species and efficient diffusion of molecules inside the pores. No metal leaching was observed from the catalyst recyclability tests, with Ce-MCM-22 maintaining high conversion and vanillin selectivity for at least five cycles.",
          "Cerium-modified zeolites have also been effective for the oxidative C-C cleavage in lignin-derived 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethan-1-one towards benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is used in a wide range of applications including plasticizers, preservatives, dyes/perfumes and as a feed for chemicals production [276]. Under aerobic conditions, at 100 °C, this lignin monomer presented 84.6 % conversion, with 71.4 % benzoic acid and 53.4 % phenol yield, in presence of 15 %Ce-5 %Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst [269]. This bimetallic catalyst leveraged the synergistic redox interaction between Cu2+/Cu+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox pairs, outperforming bulk CeO2 catalysts with only 15 % conversion. The zeolite’s two-dimensional 10-ring channels dispersed Ce active sites and facilitated molecular diffusion, leading to higher yield and selectivity. The bimetallic catalyst was also tested in the aerobic oxidation of organosolv lignin at 150 °C, resulting in 65.9 % conversion and 39.7 % product selectivity. For the oxidative cleavage of palm kernel shell biomass at 180 °C with H2O2, metal loaded zeolites like 10 %Co/H-Y and 10 %Cu/H-Y increased conversion from 75 % to 80–86 % [277]. Yields of oxidized products, including phenols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids increased from 7.54 % to 23–32 %, demonstrating the effectiveness of the addition of Co and Cu metal modifications of zeolites in promoting oxidative transformations. A comprehensive summary of the oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds in biomass-derived feedstocks using zeolitic materials is presented in Table 4, highlighting their potential in green and sustainable chemical processes."

        "content": [
          "The use of hierarchical zeolites has been extensively researched to address mass transport limitations that arise for larger biomass-derived molecule transformations. More specifically, the kinetic dimeter for many of the biomass-derived molecules is in the range of 0.5–0.9 nm for the lignocellulosic components, such as glucose and HMF, and over 10 nm for branched chain fatty acids [278,279]. As showed in the previous paragraphs, the conventional microporous zeolite structures have successfully been used for many biomass oxidative reactions. However, a better distribution of the active sites within the whole zeolite surface and easy accessibility to these active sites from the larger molecules would establish even more the suitability of these materials for biomass valorization. Hierarchical zeolites, with micropores (0.5–2 nm) and mesopores (larger than 2 nm) offer high potentials as they preserve the benefits of conventional zeolites such as crystallinity, acidity/basicity, high surface area and heating resistance, and simultaneously offer large pores for converting most of the biomass components. Table 5 summarizes previously published works on hierarchical zeolites in oxidative biomass transformations. For lignocellulosic biomass, hierarchical zeolites have been used for the selective HMF oxidation [233,280,281]. Salakhum et al. [280], prepared hierarchical zeolitic materials as supports for Pt deposition, which were used in the base-free aerobic HMF oxidation at 110 °C. According to the authors, hierarchical Pt/Na-Hie-ZSM-5 and Pt/Ca-Hie-ZSM-5 catalysts presented 100 % HMF conversion, yielding FDCA as the main product with selectivities of 35.8 % and 67.8 %, respectively. In contrast, the conventional microporous Pt/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst achieved only 67.1 % conversion, favoring DFF formation with 38.8 % selectivity and 6.4 % FDCA yield. The enhanced activity of hierarchical materials, especially Pt/Ca-Hie-ZSM-5, could be attributed to enhanced molecular diffusion within the nanosheets, smaller Pt nanoparticle size (2.5–4.5 nm), and higher support basicity. The hierarchical catalyst maintained high HMF conversion and FDCA yield even after five catalytic cycles by preserving Pt content% and showing resistance over metal sintering, contrary to Pt/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst for which a larger aggregation of Pt was found as well as severe leaching.",
          "As in the case of microporous zeolites, the choice of metal deposition method also significantly affected the catalytic activity of hierarchical zeolites. Somsri and co-workers [281], investigated deposition-precipitation (DP) and wet impregnation methods for Au deposition on hierarchical Ca-ZSM-5. The catalyst prepared via DP, Au/Ca-hie-ZSM-5 (DP), displayed smaller Au particles (∼ 1.3 nm) and exhibited complete HMF conversion with 75.1 % FDCA selectivity, whereas the wet impregnation method yielded a catalyst (Au/Ca-hie-ZSM-5-imp) with larger particles (3.6 nm) with only 43.6 % FDCA selectivity. These results highlight the importance of preparation techniques in achieving optimal catalytic performance.",
          "Hierarchical zeolites have also shown remarkable activity in the epoxidation of fatty acids. For the epoxidation of methyl oleate (MO), a hierarchical titanosilicate zeolite (TS-SP) with sponge-like morphology and mesopore diameter of 3–5.5 nm, demonstrated 100 % conversion and 91 % selectivity for epoxidized products at 90 °C [282]. In comparison, the use of microporous TS-1 increased MO conversion from 23 % (in absence of a catalyst) to only 39 %, with 62 % product selectivity. In a similar work, a catalyst system combining WO3 in physical mixture with a spongy titanosilicate (STS) not only facilitated the epoxidation of MO but also enabled the hydrolysis and oxidative cleavage of the formed vicinal diol [283]. The WO3-STS catalyst showed enhanced catalytic performance, having 94.4 % MO conversion and more than 63 % selectivity towards oxidative cleavage products, with significantly reduced WO3 leaching compared to conventional TS-1 catalyst.",
          "TS-1-based catalysts with different textural features, namely layered TS-1, pillared TS-1, and Ti-pillared TS-1 as well as mesoporous TS-1, were investigated in the liquid-phase epoxidation of MO with hydrogen peroxide at 50 °C [284]. After synthesizing layered TS-1, the obtained nanosheets were used for the preparation of pillared TS-1, in which zeolite nanosheets were connected forming a bulkier, more stable material. The catalytic activity of these materials was compared with that of microporous TS-1 and mesoporous TS-1, prepared by using carbon black pearls as a secondary templating agent. After 5 h, layered TS-1 achieved 92 % MO conversion, while mesoporous TS-1 reached 76 %, compared to 44 % for pillared TS-1 and much lower values for conventional TS-1. Despite the expansion of the interlayer distance of the pillared TS-1, the accessibility of the active sites is likely limited due to the high steric demand of MO molecules. For longer reaction time (more than 24 h), MO conversion reached 76 % for the pillared sample. For MO epoxidation with H2O2, the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atoms in TS-1 samples in combination with the hierarchical structure were found to be much more effective, compared to Ti-MCM-36 catalyst with mesopores and mainly octahedrally coordinated Ti-sites.",
          "Steam-assisted conversion (SAC) has been used to transform amorphous Ti-MCM-41 into hierarchical zeolites with varying degrees of crystallinity, significantly enhancing catalytic performance. SAC-treated Ti-MCM-41 samples (Ti-M41p), were effectively used for the epoxidation reaction of methyl oleate (MO) and methyl linolate (ML). The different treatment times generated catalysts with pores of 3 nm, which were maintained for Ti-MCM-41p-6h but totally disappeared in Ti-M41p-24h. The SAC treated samples demonstrated superior catalytic activity, with Ti-M41p-6h and Ti-M41p-12h presenting the highest conversion (66–69 %) and product selectivity (94 %). Ti-M41p sample that was treated for 24 h under steam had similar activity as the microporous TS-1, having high product selectivity (80–88 %) but very low conversion (less than 8 %). The improved catalytic performance of SAC transformed Ti-MCM-41 samples was attributed to the mesoporous surface area and crystallinity of the material. In ML epoxidation, Ti-M41p-6h facilitated the epoxidation of both CC bonds, achieving 66 % conversion and balanced product selectivity for mono- and di-epoxides, unlike microporous TS-1, which achieved only 6 % conversion [285].",
          "In the epoxidation of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME), nanosized TS-1 (TS-1_ns), synthesized via microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and subsequently recrystallized, exhibited outstanding catalytic performance. Recrystallized TS-1_ns with mesopores of 3 – 10 nm achieved 65 % FAME conversion and 82 % epoxide selectivity at 50 °C, outperforming both microporous TS-1 and desilicated TS-1 samples. Despite the larger pores of desilicated materials (10 – 40 nm) that enhance molecule diffusion, their increased surface hydrophilicity was probably unfavorable during FAME epoxidation in acetonitrile, as the alkaline-treated samples showed much lower catalytic activity even than the microporous material. Contrary, in the case of TS-1_ns, the stacked morphology through condensation of hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface was associated with an increase of the surface hydrophobicity, which enhance the adsorption of FAME molecules and thus promote their epoxidation [44]. Overall, these findings underscore the significant advantages of hierarchical zeolites in biomass oxidative transformations, with improved molecule diffusion, active site accessibility, and reduced steric hindrance contributing to their superior catalytic activity."

          "The literature summarized in this review highlights significant advances in the field of biomass upgrading, focusing on oxidative transformations, with the use of modified zeolites over the recent years. Biomass conversion reactions demand catalysts with high thermal and chemical stability, as well as reusability. Zeolites have already been established as an important class of heterogeneous catalysts that can meet these requirements. The varying number and nature of functional groups of biomass derived molecules require the use of materials with specific functionalities (active metal sites, acidity, basicity, mesoporosity). The flexibility that zeolite synthesis procedures give for preparing materials with tailored features is considered as a big advantage of zeolites compared to other heterogeneous catalysts. Especially for biomass oxidative transformations, the use of zeolites increased the sustainability factor by facilitating the use of “green” oxidants, such as O2 and H2O2, employing safer chemicals, and operating under mild reaction conditions compared to conventional processes. Metal–biomass interactions are modulated by the zeolite’s environment: the zeolite can enforce proximity of reactants to active sites, stabilize certain intermediates, or prevent bimolecular side reactions, thereby improving selectivity. Zeolite-supported catalysts often exhibit superior activity or selectivity relative to common supports (alumina, carbon, bulk oxides), due to zeolites’ structural stability, shape-selective pores, and ability to stabilize active sites (preventing metal sintering or leaching). However, microporous zeolites often face diffusion limitations, side reactions, and coke deposition in reactions involving biomass-derived molecules. Addressing these challenges and perspectives will be critical to fully exploring the potential of these materials in the sustainable development of biomass oxidative upgrading.",
          "In the oxidation of functional groups of biomass-derived molecules such as HMF and glucose, achieving high product selectivity is of high priority. While Au supported on zeolites have shown promise, a deeper understanding of the role of metal nanoparticle size, metal loading and the interactions between Au and other metals in bimetallic catalysts should be further investigated. In addition, the use of non-noble metals, which are more abundant and cost-effective, is equally important for the scale-up of these reactions to industrial applications. Moreover, zeolites have the potential to minimize or eliminate the need for additional base that is often required with other catalyst supports. Despite this, the exact role of BAS, LAS and basic sites in metal-modified zeolites remains unclear. Both glucose and HMF contain -CHO and -OH groups that can be adsorbed to acid and basic sites of zeolites, initiating the oxidation reaction. Further studies using simpler model compounds with similar functional groups (e.g., -CHO or -OH) can be used to elucidate the relationship between functional group reactivity and zeolite surface chemistry (acid/basic sites). For these studies small alcohols or aldehydes are preferred in order to avoid the influence of diffusion limitations and reveal the intrinsic catalytic activity. In such investigations, operando techniques could provide valuable insights into the interactions of reactants, intermediates and products with the catalyst during reaction. For photocatalytic reactions, research is still in its infancy, with zeolites applied mainly for glucose oxidation thus far. Despite the lower energy demands of photocatalysis compared to the thermochemical reactions and the high selectivity towards GOA/GAA, conversion values remain low. Zeolites with higher external surface areas and hierarchical structures, containing both micro- and mesopores, could significantly enhance accessibility to active sites and improve catalytic performance.",
          "Diffusion limitations also pose challenges in reactions such as CC bond epoxidation and C-C bond oxidative cleavage. For instance, the epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) derived from vegetable oils and subsequent cleavage of the corresponding vicinal diols to produce mono- or dicarboxylic acids suffer from restricted activity with microporous zeolites, which rely predominately on their external surface areas. Hierarchical zeolites, such as mesoporous TS-1, have been successfully used for overcoming these limitations in UFAs epoxidation. Further modification of these catalysts with surface active metals such as Fe, W, or Cr could promote not only the step of epoxidation but also the oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds. However, most of the currently used supports (e.g., MCM-41), despite the high conversion and product selectivity suffer from metal leaching issues and catalyst instability. The crystalline structure of zeolites could mitigate stability issues by forming strong interactions with the metal species, whether as single sites, clusters, or nanoparticles, thereby enhancing overall catalyst durability. Optimizing the oxidative cleavage of mono-unsaturated fatty acids can also open new potentials for the valorization of polyunsaturated fatty acids and lignin derived molecules that contain CC bonds (e.g., isoeugenol).",
          "While the broad use of zeolites in many of industrial processes demonstrates their potential for large-scale applications, scaling oxidative biomass conversions faces challenges – e.g. handling of solid biomass-slurry feeds, water tolerance of catalysts, and catalyst lifetime in presence of bio-impurities (N/S compounds, etc.).",
          "Addressing these challenges through targeted research will allow for the development of robust, efficient, and sustainable zeolite-based catalysts. Such advancements will not only contribute to overcoming current limitations in oxidative transformations but will also unlock new opportunities for the broader application of zeolites in biomass upgrading, fostering progress toward sustainable chemical processes."

          "The transition from fossil resources to biomass as a feedstock is of high importance for advancing a sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical industry. Biomass provides a renewable alternative, decreasing the carbon footprint and reliance on non-renewable resources. Zeolites play a pivotal role in the catalytic upgrading of biomass, thanks to their high surface area, tunable pore structures, and strong acid-base sites. The modification of zeolites with metals further enhances their catalytic properties, facilitating critical reactions such as glucose isomerization and dehydration, LA and FUR hydrogenation, sugars and fatty acids esterification, phenolics and vegetable oils hydrodeoxygenation. All of these reactions are important for the production of chemicals, materials and fuels.",
          "In oxidative biomass transformations, the use of zeolites has enabled the establishment of more safe and sustainable processes by leveraging “green” oxidizing agents such as O2 and H2O2, employing neutral solvents, and operating under mild, energy-efficient conditions. In glucose and HMF oxidation, Au supported on zeolites have showed great activity, particularly in decreasing the demands for additional base. For the partial HMF oxidation to DFF and HMFCA, zeolites modified with vanadium, cobalt and iron have exhibited high product selectivities, emphasizing the versatility of metal-modified zeolites. The role of BAS, LAS, and basic sites in facilitating the initial aldehyde and hydroxyl groups adsorption has been a key factor in promoting the overall reaction efficiency.",
          "For the epoxidation of CC bonds in unsaturated fatty acids, titanium-containing zeolites, such as TS-1, have showed great activity, particularly in reactions involving methyl oleate and vegetable oils. Further modification of TS-1 with metals such as Mo and Cd have decreased reaction times and increased product selectivity. Beyond epoxidation, unsaturated fatty acids can also be subjected to carbon-carbon bond cleavage towards the formation of bio-carboxylic acids. However, this reaction remains challenging, mainly due to the diffusion limitations of larger molecules in conventional zeolite structures.",
          "Hierarchical zeolites containing both micro- and mesopores, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. They have delivered improved catalytic performance in reactions such as HMF oxidation and fatty acids epoxidation, and they hold significant potential for oxidative cleavage reactions. This progress highlights the significant potential of tailored zeolite-based catalysts in mitigating mass transport limitations and enhancing catalytic efficiency.",
          "Collectively, the findings reviewed in this article highlight the transformative potential of zeolite-based catalysts in biomass valorization. These materials provide a platform for developing sustainable, efficient, and scalable processes that align with the goals of a bio-based chemical industry. Future research should focus in optimizing catalyst design rationally, improving reaction selectivities, and addressing challenges such as diffusion limitations and catalyst stability. By doing so, zeolites will continue to be at the forefront of innovations driving the transition towards a sustainable, circular economy."

    "abstract": "Turning crystal morphology and size of zeolite materials is crucial for promoting their diffusion and catalytic properties. Herein, MFI hierarchical lamellar zeolites with tunable SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions through the self-assembly of commercially available simple surfactant and inorganic zeolite precursor. Through detailed investigation of the crystallization process using various characterization techniques, a reliable formation mechanism of hierarchical lamellar ZSM-5 zeolite was proposed. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) acted both as a structure-directing agent and a mesoporogen, responsible for creating such structure. Hierarchical lamellar ZSM-5 can be successfully obtained by regulating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and crystallization temperature. In the 1-hexene cracking process, the hierarchical lamellar ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited significantly enhanced propylene selectivity and stability compared to conventional microporous ZSM-5. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties can effectively suppress the hydrogen transfer reaction, which plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity of C3-C5 olefins. These findings provide a facile and rational synthesis route to reduce diffusion resistance and enhance the catalytic performance of zeolite.",

          "Zeolites are significant microporous materials extensively utilized as heterogeneous catalysts in petrochemical and oil refining processes [1–3]. However, the network of sole microporosity in zeolite catalysts imposes mass transfer limitations, hindering their performance in numerous processes. Introducing mesoporosity within the microporous structure of zeolite crystals would improve mass transport and maximize structural functionalities in confined spaces [4–6]. The mesopores within zeolites not only promote the penetration of large molecules into the zeolite framework, but also help to quickly eliminate coke precursors in the zeolite, thereby reducing coke production. Therefore, zeolites with hierarchical structures demonstrate superior catalytic efficiency compared to traditional counterparts in a range of industrially relevant chemical reactions. So far, various approaches have been developed for preparing hierarchical zeolites, which include top-down approach (steaming, alkali desilication [7,8] and acid dealumination [9]) and bottom-up approach (soft templating [10–12] and hard templating [13–16]), etc [17]. Among these, soft template routes have become the preferred approach due to their more precise control over mesopore formation.",
          "ZSM-5 zeolites with MFI topology are featured for their interconnected straight and sinusoidal 10-membered ring medium pores, standing out as the main zeolite studied. Hierarchical layered MFI zeolites are particularly appealing due to their diverse stacking of zeolite layers, which significantly enhances mass transport property, accessibility to acid sites and overall catalytic performance. Ryoo’s group [18] pioneered the preparation of zeolite nanosheets utilizing a specially designed Gemini-type surfactant, C22−6−6, which serves as a template and contains at least two quaternary ammonium head groups. The zeolite nanosheets exhibited excellent catalytic performance in several reactions. However, the synthesis of these hierarchical lamellar zeolites much depends on the function of complex and expensive structure-directing agents (SDAs) as well as extended synthesis periods, which are economically disadvantageous for practical applications [19,20]. Thus, it is essential to develop facile and practical strategies that are straightforward and economical for the application of hierarchical zeolites.",
          "The simple surfactant CTAB is well-known and highly effective as a soft template. It is highly anticipated that, it can be cooperated with organic small molecule Structure-Directing Agents (SDAs) such as TPAOH and TPABr to synthesize hierarchical zeolites. Nevertheless, these two categories of organic templates, possessing different properties, usually compete rather than cooperate synergistically. This competition often leads to phase separation and the formation of independent mesopores and micropores [21,22]. Reports indicated that hierarchical MFI zeolite can be prepared by controlling the kinetics of zeolite seed formation [23] or by utilizing modified organosilanes, such as those terminated with sulfonic acid or carboxyl groups [24,25]. Nevertheless, the aforementioned methods generally consume large quantities of TPAOH/TPABr, and the use of costly organosilanes often results in a noticeable loss of crystallinity and increased costs, hindering their practical applications. In addition, when using CTAB as a soft template, most of the reported hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites form spherical aggregates. These aggregates often have disordered mesopores resulting from the random arrangements of nanocrystals. Such structures lack the superior diffusion properties characteristic of nanosheet morphologies [26,27].",
          "Propylene is a key chemical intermediate used in the production of various chemical products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and others. The demand for propylene is growing rapidly at an annual rate of 4–5 % [28,29]. Propylene is primarily sourced from the MTO (methanol to olefins) process and as a by-product via FCC and steam cracking processes, both of which generate substantial amounts of C4-C8 olefins. Olefin cracking technology not only enhances oil quality by reducing the content of olefins in FCC gasoline, but also boosts the utilization efficiency of C4-C8 olefins. Therefore, olefin cracking technology has attracted great attention in recent years. ZSM-5 is extensively utilized in olefin cracking technology for the production of propylene, owning to its distinctive pore structure and suitable acidity. The reduced path length and enhanced mass transfer in the microporous channels of hierarchical ZSM-5 contribute to an extended catalytic lifetime and a reduction in side reactions (hydrogen transfer and aromatization reaction) [30]. Therefore, hierarchical MFI zeolites with high hydrothermal and thermal stability are essential for hydrocarbons cracking.",
          "In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing MFI nanosheets featuring a multilamellar morphology. A series of mesoporous zeolites with varying SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were prepared using only commercial surfactant CTAB as the sole template, facilitated by a seed precursor. The overall crystallization process was investigated systematically and a plausible crystallization mechanism for ZSM-5 mesocrystal was proposed. Finally, the catalytic performance of the synthesized products was evaluated using hydrocarbons cracking of 1-hexene as a probe reaction. The synthesized mesoporous MFI zeolite, featuring a multilamellar morphology, demonstrated superior propylene selectivity and a longer operational lifespan compared to the conventional ZSM-5 catalysts."

          "For comparison, the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 120 was synthesized utilizing TPAOH as the SDA from a gel with a molar composition of 1SiO2:0.0083Al2O3:0.2TPAOH:0.04Na2O:18H2O. In a typical synthesis, 16.3 g TPAOH and 0.32 g NaOH were dissolved in 20 g deionized water, then 0.34 g of Al(i-PrO)3 was added to the solution, followed by homogenizing for 1 h under stirring. Finally, 15 g of Ludox AS-40 (Aldrich, 40 wt%) was added to the above solution and continuously stirred for 2 h. Hydrothermal crystallization of the obtained mixture was conducted statically at 160 °C for 48 h in Teflon-lined autoclaves. After the same post-processing as for CT-Z-x, the obtained sample was denoted as C-ZSM-5(120)."

          "High silica MFI zeolites typically crystallize using tetrapropylammonium cation (TPA+) as SDA, otherwise, α- quartz phases are usually formed [32]. The samples CT-Z-x with varying SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios (set at 60, 120, 180, 300), were initially inspected. The reaction composition was 1 SiO2:xAl2O3: 0.05CTAB: 0.15Na2O:25H2O (where x = 0.0167, 0.0083 and 0.0033) and was maintained at 140 °C for 4 days. The corresponding crystal structures of the samples were analyzed by XRD (Fig. 1 a). It clearly shows that all samples display the characteristic diffraction peaks of MFI structure, with no other peaks corresponding to impurities, implying the successful synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolites with the introduction of a certain amount of CTAB. The crystallinity of samples with different SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios does not significantly differ and is comparable to that of sample C-ZSM-5(120). ICP analysis reveals that the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio in the final synthesized samples is slightly lower than that of the initial materials (Table 1 ). For comparison, we prepared a series of samples F-Z-x with the same reaction composition but without CTAB, as depicted in Fig. 1b. The pure MFI phase was only achieved at a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 60. At ratios above this, impurity peaks belonging to the secondary phase of keatite emerged. This finding suggests that CTAB exerts a structural directing effect on the formation of MFI phase, especially at high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.",
          "The textural properties of the samples CT-Z-x were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, with the derived data presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1. As depicted in Fig. 2a, C-ZSM-5(120) exhibits a type I isotherm without a hysteresis loop, characteristic of a typical microporous material. The samples CT-Z-60, CT-Z-120, and CT-Z-180 exhibit combined type I and type IV isotherms, accompanied by distinct hysteresis loops in the range of 0.4 < P/P0 < 1, indicative of capillary condensation within the secondary mesopores. The pore size distributions inferred from Non-Local Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) method, utilizing the adsorption branch of the isotherm, are depicted in Fig. 2b. Within this pore size distribution, the micropore (∼0.56 nm) arises from the pore-filling process associated with 10 membered rings. In CT-Z-60, CT-Z-120, CT-Z-180 and CT-Z-300, mesopores can be distinctly visualized through a continuous distribution ranging from 2 to 50 nm, confirming their presence (see enlarged Fig. 2b). The micropore distribution, centered at approximately 1.0 nm, is an artifact resulting from the fluid-to-crystalline transition of N2 within micropores and does not indicate the actual existence of such pores[33]. The BET surface areas for CT-Z-60, CT-Z-120 and CT-Z-180 are 462, 438 and 482 m2/g, respectively, all of which are greater than that of C-ZSM-5(120) (338 m2/g). Concurrently, the micropore volume remains nearly constant, indicating that the intrinsic microporosity of MFI crystal structure is well preserved, in line with XRD results. However, as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio increased from 180 to 300 during the preparation process, the hysteresis loop of the isotherm became less distinct, and the external surface area decreased from 279 to 167 m2/g, which means a significant reduction in mesopores.",
          "The morphology of all samples was also investigated, as depicted in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 3 ). The SEM images highlight significant differences between the CT-Z-x samples and the conventional C-ZSM-5(120), which was synthesized using TPAOH as SDA. The SEM images show the typical hexahedral crystal with bulk structures for C-ZSM-5 (Fig. S1). Fig. 3a illustrates that CT-Z-60 consists of uniform particles with an average diameter of ca. 1 μm. The enlarged SEM and TEM images (Fig. 3b, 3c, and 3d) reveal that each particle has a flower-like morphology formed by the loose stacking of narrow, thin plate-like primary units. As the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 in the synthesis system increased from 60 to 120, the crystal morphology of CT-Z-120 changed, presenting a spherical structure with particles averaging ca. 500 nm (Fig. 3e). The expended SEM image reveals that these particle crystals are composed of denser, vertically aligned plate-like primary units, which are thicker and larger compared to those in CT-Z-60 (Fig. 3f). The TEM images further confirm the aggregated structure, where a significant amount of interlayer spaces have been created resulting in a hierarchical structure (Fig. 3g, h). CT-Z-180 exhibits a similar structural morphology and particle size to CT-Z-120, with plate-like primary units arranged more densely (Fig. 3i, j). The TEM images for this sample are also observed. Fig. 3k and l illustrate that the spherical particles of CT-Z-180 are formed by aligning and stacking crystal flakes in one direction. With an increase in the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio from 180 to 300 during the synthesis, the particle size remained at a similar level of 500 nm. It is noteworthy that at a higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 300, the synthesis yields bulky crystals with smooth surfaces and a negligible amount of mesopores. This demonstrates the enhanced grain fusion of CT-Z-300, which is consistent with the results from N2 adsorption–desorption analysis (Fig. 3m-p). The formation of large crystals may be attributed to the minimal inhibitory effect of CTA+ on crystal growth at elevated SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. As the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio increases, the negative charge on the inorganic framework decreases, reducing the attraction of CTA+ ions to the crystal surface. Similar phenomena regarding the impact of aluminium content on the crystal morphology of ZSM-5 have been reported in the literatures [34,35]. Collectively, these findings suggest that a representative hierarchical MFI crystals structure can be achieved with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios ranging from 60 and 180."

          "CTAB not only influences the crystal morphology but also directs the formation of high-silica MFI. Given that the hierarchical structure formed in the crystallization process involving single CTAB, it is crucial to elucidate the formation mechanism and control the synthesis conditions. Represented by CT-Z-60 and CT-Z-180, their crystallization processes have been monitored using XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, SEM and TEM techniques, etc. These samples were synthesized from a reaction mixture with the composition of100 SiO2:0.56 (or 1.67) Al2O3: 5CTAB: 15Na2O:2500H2O at 140 °C. The dependence of XRD patterns of CT-Z-60 on the crystallization time and the corresponding crystallization curve are given in Fig. 4 a and b. Very weak diffraction peaks corresponding to the MFI structure in the XRD pattern appeared after 5 h, then the MFI phase grew gradually with prolonged time, and the sample reached a high relative crystallinity of 92.3 % at 72 h, indicating full crystallization. Furthermore, a broad feature emerged in the low-angle region of XRD patterns (2θ = 1.8°–2.5°) observed for all samples with different crystallization times, implying a partial order at the mesoscale of the spherical particulates with the assistance of CTAB (Fig. S2a). FT-IR spectroscopy is highly sensitive to the local structural characteristics of materials. Therefore, the FT-IR spectra of CT-Z-60 were also examined over varying crystallization times. The results indicate that the band at 550 cm−1, characteristic of the double five-member ring structure of ZSM-5 zeolite, faintly appeared after 2 h and subsequently strengthened with increasing crystallization time. However, the materials synthesized for less than 2 h were amorphous, as confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. S3). The temporal evolution of morphology, as shown in SEM images (Fig. 4c–k) and TEM images (Fig. S4a), indicates that the 2 h sample consisted of worm-like amorphous aggregates. However, uniform sphere particles of ca. 500 nm with rough surfaces were observed after 5 h of crystallization. High-resolution SEM image (inset of Fig. 4d) and TEM image (Fig. S4b) reveal that these sphere particles were assembled by loosely packed primary plates. Subsequently, the primary plates grew gradually, and worm-like amorphous aggregates disappeared after 8 h of crystallization, aligning with the enhanced peaks assigned to the MFI structure in XRD patterns (Fig. 4e). Notably, when the duration was extended to 12 h, the morphology of the products changed significantly. The oriented growth of primary plates became well-defined and clearly visible, resulting in elliptical structures with nanosheets stacking (Fig. 4f, g; Fig. S4d, e). At this stage, the specific surface area (130 m2/g vs 504 m2/g) and mesopore volume (0.17 cm3/g vs 0.44 cm3/g) of the sample significantly increased due to the formation of an orderly arrangement of nanosheets (Table S1). From 48 h onwards, the primary crystalline plates grew to form arbitrarily stacked nanostripes. Concurrently, the microporous surface area gradually increased, and the BET surface area slightly decreased, which is related to the subsequent crystallization process (Fig. 4i-k; Fig. S4h, i and Table S1). The crystallization process for the formation of CT-Z-180 was also tracked (Fig. S2b, S3b, S5, S6 and Table S2), and it followed the same patterns. It is noteworthy that CT-Z-180 exhibited a much faster nucleation and crystal growth process compared to CT-Z-60. It takes 24 h for CT-Z-180 to complete the crystallization process (with a crystallinity of over 90 %), while CT-Z-60 takes 72 h to reach comparable crystallinity. This can be attributed to its decreased aluminum content. A lower aluminum content indicates a lower crystallization barrier and a higher crystallization rate. [35,36].",
          "Based on the above experiments and references to the role of CTA+ in the crystallization process of zeolite [37–39], a tentative mechanism explaining the formation of hierarchical ZSM-5 can be depicted in Scheme 1 . The amorphous silica alumina precursor of the gel, after low-temperature aging, would rapidly nucleate and crystallize with the aid of the seed solution, forming a precursor containing MFI secondary structural units (Fig. S7). In the early stages of crystallization, the precursor quickly condensed into spherical particles assembled by loosely packed primary plates. The negative charges on the surface of the silicate were compensated by alkali and CTA+ cations. Subsequently, the silicate species self-assembled into weakly ordered mesophase in the presence of CTAB surfactant. As crystallization progressed, the interaction between silicate species and the quaternary ammonium head group of CTA+ led to the formation of MFI crystals. The elongated CTA+ fit within the straight channels parallel to the b-axis, and their hydrophobic tails then had the effect of inhibiting crystal growth along the b-axis by stabilizing the a-c plane [40,41]. At low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the external surface of the crystal could adsorb more CTA+, forming a well-structured plate-like morphology. However, at a very high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (e.g., 300), the inorganic skeleton became less negative charged, resulting in less CTA+ adsorbed on the surface, thereby hindering the formation of a hierarchical structure. This is a critical factor influencing the nanosheets mophology formation of Hierarchical zeolites. This also explains why zeolite crystals formed at a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio are rougher and looser, while those formed at a higher SiO2/Al2O3 are smoother and denser[34,36].",
          "CTAB plays an important role in the synthesis of hierarchical zeolite, but it can also lead to the formation of physical mixtures of amorphous phases and zeolites in some cases[21,22]. The influence of CTAB content on the synthesis was investigated for samples CT-Z-60 and CT-Z-180, respectively. Fig. S8(a) and (b) display the XRD patterns of two series of samples synthesized with varying CTAB contents. The XRD patterns indicate that a pure phase MFI zeolite with comparable crystallinity was obtained for the sample CT-Z-60 with CTAB contents (CTAB/SiO2 molar ratios) ranging from 0 to 0.05. When the relative amount of CTAB was 0.1, sample CT-Z-60 exhibited poor crystallinity with a partial amorphous phase. On the other hand, MFI diffraction peaks with high crystallinity were obtained for sample CT-Z-180 with CTAB contents of 0.02 to 0.05. Without CTAB, poor crystallinity with a fraction of keatite was observed. At the highest CTAB content of 0.1, the sample also showed poor crystallinity containing quartz impurities. These results suggest that CTAB exerts a structure directing effect in zeolite synthesis, particularly for systems with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. However, trimethylamine (TMA) also retards the dissolution rate of silica [42], which accounts for the inability to synthesize a pure MFI phase at high CTAB content (CTAB/SiO2 molar ratio of 0.1). The SEM images and corresponding N2 adsorption–desorption data of CT-Z-60 (Fig. S9 and S11a) demonstrate that the mesoporous features increase with increasing CTAB content. Without CTAB, the sample exhibited a regular hexahedral crystal. At a CTAB content of 0.02, there was no notable alteration in the crystal morphology. However, as the CTAB content increased from 0.02 to 0.05, the crystal morphology underwent substantial alterations, evolving from hexahedral grains to spherical hierarchical structures composed of stacked thin sheets. Further increasing the CTAB content to 0.1 resulted in the appearance of amorphous phases alongside sheet-like structures within the sample. The textural parameters presented in Table S3 further confirm the influence of CTAB on pore structure. The morphology and porosity structure of CT-Z-180 exhibit the same pattern of variation with changes in CTAB content as observed in CT-Z-60 (Fig. S10 and S11b). Therefore, samples with a CTAB content of 0.05 were found to achieve an optimal balance, resulting in a pure MFI phase and hierarchical structure.",
          "The impact of crystallization temperature on the products was also investigated through variations in the synthesis temperature (Figs. S12, S13 and Table S4). The XRD peaks of samples synthesized at different crystallization temperatures exhibit little variation in intensity. SEM images and textural parameters indicate that crystallization at relatively lower temperature is preferred to that at higher temperatures. The mesoporous properties of the products are diminished at high temperatures. The influence of crystallization temperature on morphology can be understood by considering the adsorption of CTA+ onto the surface of primary embryonic grains through electrostatic attraction. At a high temperature of 180℃, desorption reduces the surface concentration of CTA+, leading to the fusion of primary grains into bulkier ones. The optimized crystallization temperature is set at 140℃ to ensure proper hierarchical pore characteristics and a high degree of crystallinity."

          "It is generally believed that the acidity of zeolites is the main factor determining their activity in cracking reaction. Before the catalytic test, the acidity of the samples was measured by NH3-TPD to calculate the number of weak and strong acid sites. Two distinct desorption peaks can be observed for each sample. The low-temperature peak, centered at ca. 160℃, is assigned to weak acid sites, while a broad desorption peak centered at ca. 350℃ is indicative of strong acid sites. To further clarify the type and amount of acid sites, Py-IR spectra were used to determine the amounts of Lewis and Brønsted acids. The bands at 1540 and 1450 cm−1 are ascribed to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. The band at 1490 cm−1 is attributed to the combined presence of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The results are shown in Fig. S14, and the acid amounts are presented in Table 2 . The acidic properties of zeolites are typically related to the content of aluminium. As expected, samples with higher Al content possess a higher number of acid sites, both weak and strong. Additionally, the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites gradually decreases as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio increases from 60 to 300. Furthermore, C-ZSM-5(120) has comparable acidity in terms of amount and type with CT-Z-120 due to their similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. Furthermore, the structural stability of CT-Z-60 and CT-Z-180 (Fig. S15) was further investigated. Following hydrothermal treatment at 700 °C for 4 h under 100 % steam atmosphere, both samples maintained high crystallinity, with CT-Z-60 retaining 88.4 % and CT-Z-180 preserving 90.6 % of their original crystallinity. The minimal changes in sample properties demonstrate their exceptional structural stability under harsh hydrothermal conditions.",
          "The catalytic properties of CT-Z-60, CT-Z-120, CT-Z-180, and CT-Z-300 were evaluated in the hydrocarbons cracking of 1-hexene. The reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure, with a temperature of 550◦C and a space velocity of 6 h−1. The corresponding product distributions are depicted in Fig. 5 , and the average product composition over an 8 h time on stream (TOS) for different samples are listed in Table 3 . Clearly, the conversions for all CT-Z-x samples exceeded 98 %, with CT-Z −120 achieving the highest yield of propylene (37.2 %) and lower yields of alkane and aromatics byproducts, demonstrating its relative superiority. The highest propylene yield and lowest byproducts yield over CT-Z-120 are likely due to its appropriate acid properties. By effectively balancing surface acidity and diffusion performance, CT-Z-120 can be considered to exhibit superior cracking performance in the 1-hexene catalytic cracking reaction.",
          "The cracking process of 1-hexene includes both mono- and bimolecular cracking reactions. It is generally believed that monomolecular reactions dominated at high temperatures, whereas bimolecular reactions prevail under low-temperature conditions [43,44]. The influence of reaction temperature on propylene selectivity was examined. The CT-Z-120, distinguished by its superior catalytic performance, was chosen for 1-hexene cracking experiments. The selectivity of main and byproducts at various reaction temperatures is shown in Fig. 6 , covering a range from 450 to 600 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the selectivity of ethylene and propylene exhibited a significant increase with rising reaction temperature, whereas the selectivity of butylene and pentene demonstrated a sharp decline. Based on the reaction pathway of 1-hexene catalytic cracking, it can be concluded that the primary products of monomolecular cracking reactions are ethylene and propylene, whereas pentene is exclusively generated through bimolecular cracking reactions[29]. Therefore, elevated temperatures facilitate the formation of ethylene and propylene. The selectivity of byproducts as a function of reaction temperature is illustrated in Fig. 6b. The selectivity of propane and butane showed a significant decline, while C1-C2 alkanes demonstrated a moderate increase. As temperature increased, the suppressed hydrogen transfer reaction became the predominant factor controlling propane and butane formation. The selectivity of aromatics showed a significant increase with rising reaction temperature, indicating that elevated temperatures promote aromatization reaction. This observation is further supported by the substantial coke formation on the catalyst. Notably, at 600 °C, the coke content increased dramatically to 3.6 % (Fig. S16), demonstrating that excessive reaction temperature significantly exacerbates coke formation. Consequently, elevated temperatures are conductive to monomolecular reactions while simultaneously suppressing hydrogen transfer reactions. However, excessively high reaction temperatures also lead to the intensification of aromatization processes.",
          "The catalytic properties of CT-Z-120 were compared with those of the microporous control sample C-ZSM-5(120), and the stability evaluation results are depicted in Fig. 7 a. In the initial stage, both ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited similar conversion rates due to the small size of 1-hexene. However, the catalysts showed different lifetimes as the time on stream (TOS) increased. CT-Z-120 exhibited better stability than C-ZSM-5(120) during the long-run testing. The conversion of 1-hexene over CT-Z-120 remained above 98 % throughout the 80 h reaction process, while C-ZSM-5(120) experienced a reduction from an initial ∼ 98 % to ∼ 92 % after 60 h of TOS. The enhanced lifetime of CT-Z-120 can be attributed to its ordered hierarchical structure. Furthermore, the corresponding product distributions in 1-hexene cracking reactions are shown in Fig. S17. The average selectivity of products and the hydrogen transfer index (HTI), calculated as Sele.(C3-4 0)/ Sele.(C3-4 =) for the two catalysts, is compiled in Fig. 7b. In terms of product distributions, CT-Z-120 exhibited higher selectivity for propylene (42.8 % vs. 31.4 %) and butylene (20.0 % vs. 14.3 %). Furthermore, the CT-Z-120 catalyst produced fewer alkane and aromatics byproducts. This is largely attributed to the superior hierarchical structure of CT-Z-120, which enhances molecular transport more efficiently and reduces the probability of hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions, thereby improving reaction performance. As is known, the two types of ZSM-5 samples with similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are quite comparable in terms of acid quantity and type; hence, crystal morphology is the most significant influential factor. The TG profiles of the catalysts after stability testing (Fig. 7c) demonstrated that CT-Z-120 possesses superior tolerance capacity to coke species, implying its ability to maintain a long-term lifetime."

          "In summary, hierarchical MFI zeolites with multilamellar structure were successfully synthesized via a self-assembly process using the simple surfactant CTAB as an SDA. Tracking and subsequent investigation of the crystallization process revealed that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and CTAB content are key factors in determining the morphology of the final products. The preparation route avoids the use of special additives and complex methods, offering an alternative and attractive pathway for the controllable synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites. The hierarchical zeolite catalyst exhibited excellent propylene selectivity and stability in the catalytic conversion of 1-hexene, attributed to enhanced diffusion properties and suppressed side reactions. Considering the synergistic effect of a suitable mesoporous structure and moderate acidity, CT-Z-120 demonstrated a higher yield of propylene, lower yields of alkane and aromatics, and a higher tolerance to coke species during 80 h reaction compared to the microporous control sample C-ZSM-5(120). This synthetic strategy is expected to pave the way for versatile methods to control the morphology of zeolites in industrial heterogeneous catalysts."

    "abstract": "The preparation of hierarchical USY zeolite, exhibiting uniform mesoporosity and high Si/Al atomic ratio (48–52), has been investigated by means of a surfactant/ammonia post-treatment applied to a commercial USY sample. The procedure involved the use of temperatures within 40–135 °C, a low ammonia concentration solution (0.05 N) and hydrothermal synthesis times of 20 h. When working at 40–80 °C, the obtained USY samples exhibit enhanced intraparticular mesoporosity (324–418 m2 g−1), showing increasingly uniform mesopores around 4.0 nm, while holding a remarkable zeolitic microporosity (413–363 m2 g−1). In contrast, higher temperatures resulted in a steady abatement of crystalline zeolitic domains, with a total collapse of the zeolite structure at 135 °C. These hierarchical USY materials were tested in the alkylation of phenol with isopropanol, wherein one of the obtained products, e.g. 2,6-diisopropylphenol (Propofol), is the most important intravenous anaesthetic in the market. Interestingly, the generation of the uniform mesoporosity in USY samples led to an enhancement of both the phenol conversion and the selectivity towards C-alkylation products. Thus, the sample treated at 60 °C (USY-60) gave rise to the highest selectivity towards C-alkylation products (84 %) and poly-alkylphenols formation (72 %), with an encouraging selectivity towards 2,6-diisopropylphenol (43 %).",

          "Hierarchical zeolites have become nowadays especially relevant catalysts for a variety of chemical reactions, leading towards higher performance than conventional zeolitic catalysts because of their enhanced accessibility [1–11]. Hierarchical zeolites are featured by the occurrence of a bimodal microporous/mesoporous structure [12] which can be developed by different procedures. This fact has allowed hierarchical zeolites to exhibit enhanced mass – transfer properties for its faster reagent diffusion rates [13,14] as well as to surpass the traditional hurdle of the small micropore size posed by conventional zeolites to bulky molecules [15]. Additionally, they have also displayed faster diffusion rates of the coke precursors resulting in lower deactivation rates [16,17].",
          "Conventional USY (Ultra Stable Y) may be regarded as a hierarchical zeolite since it shows, in addition to the typical zeolite micropores and cages of the FAU zeolite structure, a significant contribution of mesopores although showing a very broad size distribution. This mesoporosity is generated by post-synthetic modification of the zeolite Y by hydrothermal (steaming) and/or chemical (acid leaching) treatments aimed at increasing its Si/Al ratio [18]. Zeolite USY has been traditionally used as a key component of the catalyst harnessed in the fluidized catalytic cracking units (FCC) of refineries across the world [19]. Interestingly, zeolite USY has recently found new promising catalytic applications, such as the synthesis of sustainable substitutes (bisguaiacols) of Bisphenol A, a chemical traditionally used for the manufacture of different plastics, that was obtained in this case from renewable lignin sources by selective alkylation of guaiacols with isoeugenols [20].",
          "It has been reported that a more uniform mesopore size distribution in USY can be obtained by means of post-synthetic surfactant-templating method [21,22]. The procedure consisted of an alkaline treatment of the dealuminated USY zeolite (Si/Al = 15, Zeolyst CBV720) at pH between 9 and 12 (chiefly with NH3 or NaOH) in the presence of a surfactant (e.g., cethyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) at 150 °C under autogenous pressure. The so obtained material was a truly hierarchical zeolite since it showed a distinct hike of mesopore volumes (0.50 cm3 g−1 vs. 0.16 cm3 g−1) while preserving a considerable microporosity (0.21 cm3 g−1). In addition, it displayed a uniform mesopore size distribution centered at 4.0 nm. Interestingly, following this method, the mesopore size can be tuned within the 3.0–6.0 nm interval by increasing the surfactant alkyl chain length between C12 – C22, respectively [23]. The formation of the hierarchical uniform mesoporosity in zeolite Y was explained in terms of a surfactant-assisted crystal rearrangement mechanism [21]. It is noteworthy that the occurrence of a starting mesoporosity in the zeolite NaY sample was reported not to be required for the success of the surfactant-templating procedure [24]. However, over zeolite ZSM-5 [25] and Beta [26] samples, the existence of a previous broad mesoporosity distribution within the 2.0–8.0 nm range originated by the protozeolitic silanization method, was found to facilitate the formation of uniform mesopores in a subsequent surfactant templating treatment with regards to those lacking it. On the other hand, the uniform mesoporous USY was successfully tested in an FCC unit of a refinery, showing enhanced hydrothermal stability and catalytic cracking selectivity [27], which paved the way for its current large-scale industrial implementation in refineries across the world. In addition, hierarchical zeolites based on mesoporous Y and obtained by interzeolite transformation using surfactants, showed excellent textural properties and strong acidity, leading towards superior catalytic performances in reactions involving bulky substrates such as the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indole with benzhydrol or the cracking of polystyrene [28]. Likewise, hybrid zeolites formed by FAU partial zeolite interconversion into MFI harnessing surfactants exhibited enhanced conversion and selectivity in the cracking of the bulky 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene [29].",
          "Expanding the catalytic applications of USY zeolite with uniform mesoporosity to other fields different from FCC units, such as fine chemicals synthesis, can be of great interest to take advantage of the singular properties of this material. This is the case of the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenolic compounds that may lead to a variety of valuable products. Moreover, phenolics alkylation is an interesting process to upgrade lignin-derived pyrolysis bio-oil towards valuable chemicals [30]. In this way, the products obtained from phenol alkylation with isopropanol have important commercial applications: isopropylphenols are widely applied as flavours, adhesives, agriculture chemicals and pharmaceuticals [31], whereas 2,6–diisopropylphenol, commonly referred to as propofol, is the most worldwide used intravenous anaesthetics [32]. In addition, mixtures of different diisopropylphenols are used as intermediates for the manufacture of flame retardants [33]. Both alcohols and light olefins can be used as alkylation agents of phenolics whereas the activity of the catalyst strongly depends on its acidity and porosity [11,34,35]. In this respect, catalysts containing Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are known to favor C-alkylation (C-C coupling reaction) while those possessing Lewis acid sites (LAS) promote instead O-alkylation (C-O coupling reaction) [36–38]. Thus, a variety of zeolites and acid ordered mesoporous solids have been investigated in this type of reactions showing the relevance of accessibility issues due to the bulky nature of the products [39–42]. In this regard, hierarchical structured ZSM-5 zeolite, consisting of c-axis oriented nanorods, has been investigated as catalyst in phenol alkylation with isopropanol, showing enhanced catalytic activity and stability due to its mesoporosity that facilitates the diffusion of reactant and product molecules [43]. Accordingly, the reaction of alkylation of phenol with isopropanol can be considered an interesting test to check the influence of the uniform mesoporosity generated by the surfactant-templating procedure in the hierarchical USY samples. To some extent, this method may be regarded as a variation of the original desilication procedure [44]. The Si/Al atomic ratio of the zeolite is expected to wield a big influence since the abatement of the Al content of the zeolite turns them less stable towards the basic attack. However, a lower Al content of the zeolite may be positive for preventing a fast deactivation in the catalytic applications. Therefore, in the present work, a high silica USY sample (Si/Al = 40) was used as raw material, being subjected to the surfactant-templating procedure. The experimental conditions of this treatment were optimized regarding to those earlier reported [45] in order to achieve a better control of the properties of the final hierarchical zeolite, which resulted in a remarkable enhancement of its catalytic performance in the phenol alkylation with isopropanol."

The high-angle XRD patterns were collected within the 5–50° range using a step size of 0.1° and a counting time of 10 s. Low angle XRD patterns were also obtained within the 0.5–10° range to detect the formation of MCM-41-like phases.

          "The generation of uniform mesoporosity proceeds through a surfactant-assisted crystal rearrangement mechanism published elsewhere [21], which comprises three steps. The first one involves the opening/reconstruction of some Si-O-Si bonds of the zeolite crystals in basic media, that is followed by a second step of crystal rearrangement to allow for their self-assembly with the surfactant cationic micelles. Finally, a third step consisting of a calcination to remove the surfactant occurs that uncovers the crafted uniform mesoporosity. Initially, the surfactant-templating procedure was tested upon the commercial USY (CBV780) with high Si/Al atomic ratio (40) under similar experimental conditions to that published elsewhere [21]. Thus, in an autoclave reactor, a 0.37 M aqueous ammonia solution plus the surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) and the USY zeolite were treated under autogenous pressure at 135 °C for 20 h. However, these experimental conditions were too harsh for the commercial USY (CBV780) zeolite resulting in its whole amorphization, according to its XRD pattern (data not shown). Therefore, softer reaction conditions are to be chosen to slow down the kinetics of the mesoporosity generation. As the presence of lower amounts of aluminum in the USY zeolite decreases its stability, especially against the alkaline treatment responsible of the Si-O-Si cleavage in the first step of the surfactant-templating procedure [45], our focus was put on diminishing the rate of this step of the method. Thereby, the concentration of ammonia loaded into the autoclave was decreased meaningfully (0.05 M), holding the same amount of surfactant and reaction time. Additionally, the temperature was selected as the main variable to trigger the generation of uniform mesoporosity in the commercial USY (CBV780) zeolite. Thus, different hierarchical USY samples were prepared by increasing the temperature stepwise from 40 to 135 °C, so the following ones were investigated: 40, 60, 80, 100 and 135 °C. Likewise, the obtained samples were named as USY-X, wherein X stands for the temperature in °C studied in the surfactant treatment procedure.",
          "The textural properties of the calcined USY samples, obtained from the previous nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196.15 °C, are summarized in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the BET surface area increases for the USY-40 and USY-60 samples slightly above 800 m2 g−1 regarding to the parent USY sample (654 m2 g−1) and it then diminishes for the samples treated at higher temperatures. However, the more interesting results arise from the evolution of micropore and mesopore/external surface areas and volumes, respectively. In this respect, the micropore surface areas (SMICRO) decrease steadily from USY (437 m2 g−1) and USY- 40 (479 m2 g−1) to USY-135 (31 m2 g−1) on increasing the temperature of the surfactant-templating treatment. In parallel, the mesopore/external surface area (SMES + EXT) follows the opposite trend, and it augments with the temperature of the surfactant templating treatment from USY and USY–40 (217 and 324 m2 g−1, respectively) to USY–135 (490 m2 g−1). Likewise, the micropore (VMICRO) and mesopore volumes (VMES) follow similar variations to those of the micropore surface (SMICRO) and mesopore/external surface (SMES + EXT), respectively. The decrease of the micropore volumes with the concurrent augment of the mesoporosity for the samples USY-40, USY-60 and USY-80 can be ascribed to the breakage of the micropores walls for the accommodation of the micelles of the cationic surfactant during the crystal rearrangement step of the surfactant-templating procedure [21]. In contrast, because of the practical absence of zeolitic domains and of their associated microporosity in the samples treated at higher temperature (100 and 135 °C, respectively), they were regarded as virtually amorphous and ruled out for further studies. On the other hand, due to the remarkable features of USY- 40, USY-60 and USY-80 in terms of their respective textural properties, they were chosen alongside the reference USY to perform Ar adsorption-desorption isotherms at −186.15 °C in order to determine the pore size distributions by means of the NL-DFT method [48]. In this regard, Fig. S1 of the Supporting Information shows the Ar adsorption-desorption isotherms at −186.15 °C while Fig. 3 depicts their respective cumulative pore volumes and pore size distributions, obtained from these isotherms by application of the NL-DFT procedure. Thus, for the reference USY, the pore size distribution points out a main peak centered at pore diameter (Dp) ∼ 0.75 nm corresponding to zeolite Y micropores. Additionally, a smaller one centered at 1.2–1.5 nm can be observed that has been also detected elsewhere [52] in the DFT pore size distributions obtained for HY, HBeta and HZSM-5 zeolites. This peak stems from the occurrence of a small low pressure hysteresis loop, that has been associated with a structural transformation of the zeolite framework during the adsorption due to their non-rigid structure [51]. Finally, a broader mesopore size distribution located within the 2.0–6.0 nm range was appreciated for the parent USY.",
          "As inferred from Fig. 3, on increasing the temperature of the surfactant-templating treatment, the micropore peak tends to decrease while the initially broad mesopore size distribution within 2.0–6.0 nm turns into a clear peak centered at 4.0 nm, indicative of a more uniform mesopore size distribution generated by the surfactant-templating procedure [21]. This peak is rather uniform and bigger for the USY – 60 and especially USY-80 samples.",
          "The Si/Al atomic ratio of the chosen USY, USY-40, USY-60 and USY-80 samples, determined by ICP-AES, are shown in Table 1 and they were rather similar (Si/Al ∼ 48–52), showing that the ammonia/surfactant treatment does not provoke any selective removal of Si or Al species. Fig. 5 illustrates the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the calcined parent USY and of the obtained USY-40, USY-60 and USY-80 samples. Only two peaks are clearly observed in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra, located at chemical shifts (δ) of ∼60 ppm and ∼0 ppm, that have been assigned to tetrahedral (AlIV) and octahedral (AlVI) aluminum species, respectively [53,54]. No signal at ∼35 ppm from pentahedral aluminum species (AlV) was detected in any of the spectra. Traditionally, tetrahedral aluminum has been ascribed to aluminum incorporated into the zeolite framework while octahedral aluminum is assigned mostly to extraframework aluminum species (EFAL). It is noteworthy that all the three studied samples presented shares of tetrahedral aluminum above 60 %, the highest value corresponding to USY-40 sample (82.7 %). This is in keeping with the higher crystallinity observed for this sample amid the surfactant treated ones by both XRD and TEM techniques. On the other hand, the relative contributions of tetrahedral and octahedral aluminum vary significantly among the samples. Hence, the starting commercial USY sample contains a meaningful amount of octahedral aluminum (27.5 %), likely by the occurrence of extraframework aluminum species generated during the dealumination treatment that remains occluded inside the zeolitic pores. Interestingly, after the surfactant-templating treatment at 40 °C, there was an abatement of the amount of octahedral aluminum (17.3 %). This fact suggests that some reincorporation of extraframework aluminum species into the zeolite USY framework, becoming tetrahedral aluminum, took place thanks to the basic treatment with the surfactant at this temperature. Additionally, the FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) of the tetrahedral peak for USY-40 diminishes to 7.6 ppm regarding reference USY (8.6 ppm), indicating the existence of more ordered tetrahedral Al environments inside the framework for this sample. In this regard, this finding is in agreement with the reinsertion of non-framework aluminum into tetrahedral positions as it has been previously reported for dealuminated zeolite Y (Si/Al = 4.26) after basic treatment with KOH at 80 °C [55]. In contrast, on increasing the temperature of the surfactant templating treatment, the amount of octahedral aluminum tends to augment steadily reaching 22.6 % and 38.8 % at 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Likewise, the FWHM of the tetrahedral peak also augments for USY-60 (7.8 ppm) and especially, for USY-80 (11.1 ppm) bearing out the formation of more distorted tetrahedral Al in its framework [56]. This is indicative of a progressive damage of the zeolite USY lattice when increasing the temperature of the surfactant-templating treatment.",
          "The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of all the samples are depicted in Fig. 6 . They display two main peaks placed at chemical shifts (δ) of ∼ −102 and −107 ppm that have been assigned to Si(1Al) and Si(0Al) (Q4) units of dealuminated FAU zeolite, respectively [54,57]. In this regard, Si(1Al) and Si(0Al) moieties correspond to silicon environments wherein Si atoms are surrounded by one and zero atoms of aluminum, respectively. Additionally, the signal at −102 ppm may be ascribed as well to silanols Q3(0 Al) groups [58]. It is noteworthy that the 29Si MAS NMR spectra shows a clear trend of increasing the share of the signal at ∼ −102 ppm with a parallel decrease in the signal at ∼ -107 ppm with increasing temperatures of the surfactant-templating treatment. Hence, the contribution of the ∼-102 ppm signal hikes from 28 % in the starting USY to a 39 % for the USY-80 sample. As the amount of aluminum in the framework is not expected to rise as a consequence of the surfactant-templating treatment, this augment is meant to be associated to a parallel increase in the share of silanol Q3 species, instead of that of Si(1Al) moieties. This fact points out the occurrence of a larger number of defects (e.g., silanol nests) into the USY zeolite framework at higher temperatures of the surfactant-templating treatment, bearing out their amorphization above 80 °C [59]. In this respect, amorphous silica-alumina are featured by showing Q3/Q4 ratios close to 1 [60], so the increase in the Q3 ratio hints at the formation of some amorphous phase as well, which aligns with the surface covering by amorphous silica-alumina inferred from Figure S2 and Fig. 4 for USY-80 sample, causing the partial/total closure of some large mesopores."

          "Traces of propene and diisopropyl ether were detected in the reaction liquid products indicating that isopropyl alcohol was, at least, partially dehydrated on the acid sites by protonation followed by β-elimination to form propene and water. Dehydration of isopropanol on HY needs a lower activation energy compared to other zeolites, so it happens at lower temperatures [61]. Besides, isopropanol dehydrates faster than other alcohols [62], thus making this reaction route feasible. Both isopropanol and propylene can perform alkylation on the oxygen (O-alkylation) or the carbon position (C-alkylation), but the alcohol favours the O-alkylation route while propylene favours the C-alkylation route [62]. Since isopropanol dehydration is faster than phenol alkylation on the acid sites of zeolites, the alkylation of phenolic compounds is usually carried out by propylene [63]. According to the results in Fig. 8, the C-alkylation route is the main reaction mechanism for all the catalysts. This supports the formation of propylene prior to alkylation.",
          "The BrØnsted/Lewis acidity ratio could also affect the selectivity to O-alkylation vs. C-alkylation. Thus, it has been reported that BrØnsted acid sites (BAS) tend to favor C-alkylation while the Lewis acid sites (LAS) promote O-alkylation instead [36]. The mesoporogenic treatment slightly damages the crystalline structure of the parent USY zeolite and, therefore, some BrØnsted acid sites are inevitably lost for USY-40, USY-60 and USY-80 samples with regards to the reference USY (Fig. 6). However, surprisingly, the selectivity to O-alkylphenols decreases from 41 % for the parent USY to 16 % for USY-60, while selectivity to C-alkylphenols correspondingly increases from 59 % to 84 % in spite of the lower BAS concentration in the hierarchical samples. In addition, although USY-80 has a less crystalline structure, it performs very similarly to USY-60, indicating that the catalytic behaviour not only relies on the acidic nature of the zeolite. These results can be attributed to the higher and more uniform mesoporosity of both USY-60 and USY- 80 catalysts, that favors the formation of the bulkier products obtained during C-alkylation (mostly poly-alkylphenols).",
          "It is interesting that the main product of O-alkylation was propoxybenzene while the group O- + C-alkylphenols comprises mostly phenol, x-(1-methylethyl)-, acetate (for x = 2 or 4). The compound propoxy-benzene is clearly derived from propylation of the -OH feature of phenol, but the occurrence of both phenol acetates poses certain doubts. The most likely origin of these acetates, present in minor amounts, might lie in an unexpected and undesired catalytic transesterification reaction between the ethyl acetate solvent added after reaction to help dissolve any phenolic compounds and certain amount of both phenol, 2-(1-methylethyl) and phenol, 4-(1-methylethyl)- obtained as reaction products. This fact might slightly alter the proportion of O-alkylation and C-alkylation. However, considering the low shares of acetates attained in the final selectivity, its influence has been regarded as scarcely relevant.",
          "Additional kinetics experiments at 150 °C were performed during shorter reaction times (0.5 and 1 h) over both reference USY and USY-60 to elucidate the evolution of the reaction pathways, which are shown in Fig. S4 and Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The conversions of phenol and isopropanol over both catalysts increased along the reaction time, being always higher over USY-60 zeolite than for USY. Likewise, the selectivity towards C-alkylation is always higher than that towards O-alkylation over both catalysts at any time, with the only exception at 0.5 h over USY, mostly caused by the remarkable selectivity towards propoxybenzene (57.1 %) being attained. In this respect, the selectivity towards O-alkylation is higher at shorter times (0.5 or 1 h) than at longer times (4 h), over both USY and USY-60 catalysts. It is noteworthy as well that the selectivity towards the desired 2,6-diisopropylphenol increases steadily with the reaction time over the USY-60 catalyst up to reaching 43 % after 4 h of reaction. Likewise, over USY, the selectivity to this compound also augmented along the time but in a far lower extent, reaching roughly 28 % after 4 h of reaction. This fact suggests that the uniform mesoporosity of USY-60, combined with its suitable combination of Brønsted/Lewis acidity indeed boosts its formation. On the other hand, an additional reaction at 150 °C for 1 h over USY harnessing double amount of isopropanol (molar ratio 3/1) was carried out, whose results are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S4 of the Supporting Information, compared to those of ratio 1.5/1. The obtained phenol conversions increased from 27 % to 39 % in the presence of a higher alcohol amount while the isopropanol conversion descended to only 64 % in this additional test due to the augmented excess of isopropanol. However, the selectivity towards O-alkylated products increased distinctly, especially to propoxybenzene which reaches a remarkable 59.8 %. Likewise, the selectivity towards C-alkylated products decreased meaningfully, so the shares of 3-propylphenol, 2,4-diisopropyphenol and the target 2,6-diisopropylphenol were just 15.6, 6.7 and 8.7 %, respectively. Consequently, the augment in the amount of isopropanol resulted in an undesired shift in the selectivity towards O-alkylated products, chiefly propoxybenzene, so it was discarded for further studies.",
          "Both alkylation routes are favoured under the presence of strong acid sites, as mentioned before. The proposed scheme of reactions occurring is depicted in Fig. S3. Thus, the O-alkylated products are ethers whose etherification reaction is an equilibrium that may be reversed as isopropyl alcohol is consumed by its dehydration to propene over the BrØnsted acid sites, facilitating the subsequent C-alkylation of the phenolics products [64]. Hence, the formation of O-alkylated products is kinetically favoured in the initial steps of the reaction but these components later tend to be converted into the C-alkylated products, that constitutes more stable final species [65]. On the other hand, the possibility of the direct isomerization of the O-alkylphenols to the C-alkyl products have been ruled out based on earlier works [63,66].",
          "Strong acidity is also needed to promote C-dialkylation vs. C-monoalkylation [67,68]. However, the formation of the di-alkylphenols necessarily requires large pores in order to avoid steric hindrances. Thus, di-alkylation was found to be minimal on ZSM-5, and it is much favoured on H-Beta and, specially, HY, for the faujasite-type zeolite presents a framework system of supercages interconnected in a 3-D structure of channels [62,68]. Therefore, the uniform mesoporosity of the hierarchical USY samples was expected to increase the share of di-alkylphenols. Fig. 9 depicts the correlation between the selectivity to poly-alkylphenols (di- and tri-alkylphenols) and the accessibility of the zeolite, referred to as the mesopore + external surface area (SMES + EXT) of the USY catalysts. Only C-alkylphenols were considered in this case to avoid the influence of different reaction routes, with different reaction rates, taking place simultaneously. It is evident that zeolites USY-60 and USY-80, with mesopore + external surface areas above 400 m2 g−1 and more uniform mesoporosity are able to produce much higher amounts of larger phenolics (72 % for USY-60) than the parent USY (51 %) with an accessible surface area of 217 m2 g−1, which accounts for an increase of ≈40 %. Poly-alkylphenols were formed at the expenses of the monosubstituted compounds, following a two-step pathway, as depicted in Fig. S3. This is in agreement with previous findings on phenols alkylation which evidenced that di-alkylphenols derived from secondary alkylation of mono-alkylphenols [67]. The same authors have also reported that di-alkylation is enhanced when the catalysts present both Lewis and BrØnsted acid sites plus high specific surface area as it is the case of the present study."

          "Hierarchical USY materials with uniform mesoporosity and high Si/Al ratio (48–52) were successfully synthesized from the parent USY sample following a modified surfactant-templating approach based on the use of softer conditions to avoid the collapse of the FAU structure. In this regard, low ammonia concentration (0.05 N) and moderate temperatures (40–80 °C) combined with the action of the surfactant led towards the formation of hierarchical USY zeolites with remarkable textural properties. In contrast, higher temperatures (100–135 °C) resulted in the collapse of the zeolite structure. It is noteworthy that at 40–60 °C, the share of tetrahedral aluminum was still above 70 % while higher temperatures triggered the formation of increasing amount of silanols. The surfactant-templating treatment brought about as well a slight abatement of the amount of BrØnsted acid sites, that is especially relevant for those of higher strength.",
          "On the other hand, the catalytic tests of phenol alkylation with isopropanol disclosed the remarkable performance of USY-60 in both C-alkylation and poly-alkylphenols formation, which is in keeping with its high accessibility arising from its hierarchical porosity with uniform mesopores as well as its suitable combination of Brønsted/Lewis acidity. Interestingly, USY-60 led towards a remarkable 43 % selectivity of 2,6-diisopropylphenol, which constitutes a valuable compound, commercialized as Propofol, the worldwide most important intravenous anaesthetic. These facts render USY-60 into a promising catalyst for the synthesis of bulky valuable alkylphenols, not only from pure phenol but also from bio-oils obtained by lignin-rich feedstocks."

          "Hierarchical zeolites, which possess both intrinsic zeolitic pores and additional secondary porosity, have attracted significant attention in catalysis due to their significantly enhanced diffusion properties compared to conventional microporous zeolites [1]. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites typically relies on various mesoporogens to induce the formation of secondary porosity [2,3]. However, this route not only increases production costs but also raises environmental concerns. Additionally, the synthesis process usually takes several tens of hours [4], further limiting the scalability of hierarchical zeolites for industrial applications.",

This ultrafast, mesoporogen-free approach effectively reduces the production cost of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, making them highly attractive for large-scale applications in the chemical industry."

When the reaction was conducted at 250 °C, the synthesis gel solution remained clear for the first 10 min, with no solid product formed. After another 10 min, the gel solution turned milky white (Fig. 1a), and the solid product was confirmed to be highly crystallized ZSM-5 crystals (Fig. 1b). SEM (Fig. 1f and 1 g) and TEM (Fig. 1h) images further confirm the successful formation of a mulberry-like hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with a slightly elongated morphology, while maintaining its nearly single-crystalline structure (inset in Fig. 1h).",
          "To further shorten the synthesis time of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, we added ZSM-5 seeds (5 wt% based on SiO2) to the synthesis gel to accelerate zeolite nucleation. As shown in Fig. 3 a, when the reaction was conducted at 250 °C, the crystallization time was further reduced to 10 and 15 min, resulting in poorly and highly crystallized ZSM-5 zeolites, respectively. This suggests that the promoting effect of the zeolite seed was minimal, and consequently, the growth of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was not effectively constrained by the nucleation step. It is worth noting that the morphology of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite is similar to that in our previous study [5], where it was prepared using a conventional autoclave. However, the reaction time was significantly reduced. Therefore, the high crystallization rate can largely be attributed to the minimal thermal lag of the stainless-steel tube reactor [7,8], as its thin-walled tubular structure facilitated rapid heat transfer to the synthesis gel, especially at high reaction temperatures. It should be noted that, after being heated in a 250 °C oven for 30 min, the temperature inside the tubular reactor reached only approximately 180 °C (Fig. S1). This indicates a significant thermal lag and suggests there is still room to further shorten the crystallization time. Additionally, it is important to note that only the combination of TEOS and NaAlO2 as silicon and aluminum sources yields highly crystallized hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, when other combinations, such as TEOS and AIP, colloidal silica and NaAlO2, or fumed silica and NaAlO2, were used, only amorphous products were obtained (Fig. 3b), even though the reaction was conducted at 250 °C for as long as 60 min. This may be attributed to the high nucleation rate of the TEOS and NaAlO2 combination, resulting from the high solubility of both Si and Al species in the system. These findings further highlight the critical role of silicon and aluminum sources in the ultrafast, mesoporogen-free synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites."

    "abstract": "Hierarchical and two-dimensional (2D) zeolites have drawn much attention in catalysis and separation process due to their fast mass transfer. However, the facile manipulation in controllable mesopore volumes and morphologies for hierarchical nanozeolites is full of challenges. Herein, a facile strategy is presented for the synthesis of single-crystalline 2D hierarchical MFI zeolite nanosheets (HNSs) with tunable mesopore volumes through the amino acid-assisted crystallization of nucleated amorphous silicon precursors (NASPs). The tailored synthesis of HNSs with controllable aspect ratios ((Lc\n                      + La\n                     )/Lb\n                     ), b-axis thicknesses (a few tens of nanometers) and mesopore volumes is achieved by adjusting the preparation of the NASPs and the amount of amino acid in the synthesis mixture. The HNSs exhibit large BET surface area (>400 m2 g-1), high micropore volume (0.16–0.18 cm3 g−1) as well as rich mesopore volume (>0.10 cm3 g−1), indicating the high crystallinity of the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets. Specially, the higher adsorption capability and faster adsorption rate for the dye (Rhodamine B) adsorption demonstrate the excellent performance of the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets, which exhibits the maximum adsorption capacity of 115.7 mg g−1. The controllable manipulation of mesoporous volumes and morphologies in MFI zeolites represents a significant contribution to the field of zeolite microstructure engineering.",

          "Zeolite materials have excellent hydrothermal stability, uniform micropores and tunable acidity, which have been widely used in the heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption and membrane separation process [1–7]. However, the sole micropores (<2 nm) of zeolites seriously limit the diffusion rate of guest molecules, resulting in secondary reactions, coke formation, as well as the reduction in flux of zeolite membranes [8–10]. Afterward, hierarchical zeolites have been prepared by employing hard/soft templates or by post-treatment via steaming, leaching, or etching to improve the internal diffusion efficiency of zeolites [11–14]. In addition, other strategies including reducing zeolites crystal size into the nanometer scale and transforming their structure from conventional 3D to 2D architectures were developed to solve the diffusion problem. For example, MFI 2D-zeolite nanosheets with shortened diffusion path along the straight channel (b-axis) exhibit remarkable catalytic performance in chemical industrial reactions and superior separation ability in membrane applications [15–18]. Specially, it can be predicted that the 2D-hierarchical MFI zeolite nanosheets are able to integrate the properties of hierarchical zeolites and zeolite nanosheets.",
          "So far, great efforts based on top-down and bottom-up synthesis strategies have been paid to the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets [19–22]. The top-down method usually requires a multi-step approach for the exfoliation of layered zeolite precursors by post-synthesis treatment, such as ultrasound. Alternatively, the bottom-up strategy adopts templated crystallization from unique organic structural directing agents (OSDAs) (e.g., C22-6-6 [22], diquat-C5 cations [16]), and additive-assisted synthesis (e.g., fluorine-containing inorganic acids/salts [15,23], urea [24], PHMB [25,26]) to prepare zeolite nanosheets with adjustable thickness along the b-axis. In summary, most reported strategies for the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets need expensive organic template agents or environmentally harmful additives, resulting in complex preparation processes and time-consuming, which seriously limits their practical industrial applications. What is worse, structural collapse is usually inevitable during post treatment, causing a high level of framework defects and low crystallinity. Importantly, the facile synthesis and regulation on the aspect ratio of high-quality hierarchical MFI zeolite nanosheets remains a big challenge.",
          "Recently, the particular precursor species for zeolite crystallization have drawn much attention owing to its primary role in the formation of zeolite structure [27–31]. For instance, Yu et al. prepared protozeolites as particular precursor species and succeeded in the synthesis of single-crystalline hierarchical nanozeolites as well as zeolite nanosheets [27–29]. Besides, Tang et al. extracted uniform precursor nuclei (called as subcrystals) from the synthetic solution of silicalite-1 zeolite during nucleation period, and demonstrated a unitary oriented aggregation of these subcrystals to form zeolite nanosheet [30,31]. These findings indicate that the particular precursor species strongly affect the crystal growth, morphology and microstructure of zeolites. Notably, most of the reported synthesis methods employed tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as raw material to prepare the precursor species, and after its complete hydrolysis, the evaporation of water and ethanol had to be carefully controlled. Besides, after hydrothermal synthesis of the precursor species (e.g., protozeolites and subcrystals), multi-step treatment was followed by washing, centrifugation or dialysis procedure, which is time-consuming, costly and low-yield. Additionally, it is well known that the crystallization process of zeolite is an intricate and multifaceted process, posing difficulties on the kinetic regulation [27]. Consequently, the controllable regulation on the morphology (e.g., aspect ratio: (Lc + La )/Lb ) and microstructure (e.g., mesopores) of zeolite nanosheets have been rarely investigated although it is of importance to provide deep insights into the growth mechanism of zeolite crystals.",
          "In our previous work of MFI zeolite nanocrystal synthesis, low-cost solid silica gel was mixed with the OSDA solution to form a semi-solid-like gel by simply mixing and grinding, and a large number of active species were produced through a short time of heating treatment at low temperature [32]. Herein, the nucleated amorphous silicon precursors (NASPs) were prepared by a similar method [32], and then the NASPs were crystallized into single-crystalline 2D-hierarchical MFI zeolite nanosheets (HNSs) under the assistance of the low cost, non-toxic amino acid rather than environmentally harmful fluorine-containing additives. Namely, a facile amino acid assisted constructing of HNSs via decoupling nucleation-crystallization method was demonstrated. By using the above synthetic strategy, the controllable regulation of the morphology and the hierarchical microstructure in the HNSs was achieved by a simple control in the preparation of the NASPs and an addition of amino acid. Importantly, the HNSs show tunable mesopores, high crystallinity, less defects as well as high hydrothermal stability. Finally, the adsorption capability of the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets for the dye adsorption was investigated. This work provides a rapid, facile, low cost, and environmentally friendly method to synthesize HNSs, which is suitable for large-scale industrial production."

          "The 2D-hierarchical MFI zeolite nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a decoupling nucleation-crystallization method, by which the evolution process could be decoupled into two steps: I): nucleation at low temperature, and II): crystallization at high temperature under the assistance of amino acid. During the synthesis process of NASPs, a semi-solid-like gel was constructed by simply mixing and grinding solid silica gel, NaOH with a TPAOH aqueous solution, followed by heating at the low temperature. It is well known that a low temperature is preferred for nucleation in zeolite synthesis. Therefore, the formation of NASPs in this work is also referred to nucleation process. The formation of the NASPs during nucleation process is crucial for the adjustment of controllable crystal aspect ratio of zeolite nanosheets. Consequently, the effects of nucleation temperature and time were investigated. The NASPs (P-T(t)) were prepared at different nucleation temperatures (30–60 °C) for different times (0, 1, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h) using the synthesis mixture of 1 SiO2: 0.13 NaOH: 0.14 TPAOH: 4.76 H2O, and the HNSs samples (HNS-PT(t)) were crystallized at 160 °C for 72 h using the synthesis mixture of 1 SiO2: 0.14 TPAOH: 0.13 NaOH: 0.5 lysine: 50 H2O. As shown in Figure S1 a, in a nucleation process-free synthesis, the 3D bulk zeolite crystals (HNS-PT(0)) were obtained, whose crystal size was close to 30 μm due to less crystal nuclei in the synthesis mixture. Remarkably, only prolonging the nucleation time to 1 h, the obtained sample HNS-P50(1) shows sharply decreased particle size of 5.0 μm × 1.0 μm × 200 nm ( Figure S1 b). Furthermore, SEM images in Fig. 1 a-d show that all the zeolite samples grown from the NASPs (P-50(t = 6–24 h)) exhibit a well-defined 2D nanosheet-like morphology. XRD patterns (Fig. 1 e) of the samples show typical characteristic peaks of the MFI structure and the high crystallinity of zeolite materials. Fig. 1 f and Table 1 depict the crystal size along different axis of the MFI 2D-nanosheets versus the nucleation time. The result indicates that the formation of the NASPs in the nucleation process is important for the synthesis of 2D-MFI zeolites. And the crystal size of the MFI nanosheets is significantly reduced with the prolonged duration of nucleation. For example, prolonging the nucleation time from 6 h to 24 h (50 °C), the length along the c-axis of zeolites gradually decreases from 1.5 to 0.4 μm, in the same time the thickness along the b-axis decreases from 120 to 50 nm. Meanwhile, the (Lc + La )/Lb spirally decreases from 30.0 to 12.0 as the nucleation time increases from 1 to 24 h (50 °C). It follows the same trend in the case that the NASPs were prepared at lower temperature (30 and 40 °C) (Table 1, Figures S2 and S3 ). Note that a higher nucleation temperature (e.g., 60 °C) with a shorter nucleation time (6 h) could lead to the formation of 2D-zeolites."

          "Furthermore, the changes of mesopore volume in HNSs obtained under different lysine/SiO2 ratios were studied by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm ( Figure S7 , Table 2 , Fig. 2 c). The capillary condensation in the high pressure (P/P0 = 0.90–1.0) region in the nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis demonstrates mesopores [34,35]. Note that the HNS-L0 zeolites show a mesoporous volume value of 0.05 cm3 g−1, which is much lower than that of HNS-L x (x > 0.3). Interestingly, the mesoporous volume follows a volcano shape with the lysine/SiO2 ratio and reaches the summit at lysine/SiO2 ratio = 0.5 with the highest mesoporous volume value of 0.17 cm3 g−1. Importantly, all the samples exhibit large BET surface area (>400 m2 g-1) and large micropore volume (0.16–0.18 cm3 g−1), demonstrating the highly crystalline MFI-type zeolites. It is consistent with the high intensity observed in their XRD ( Figure S8 ). Usually, the microporous crystalline framework of the hierarchical zeolites is damaged, leaving a large number of defective sites and/or amorphous regions formed in zeolites and exhibiting poor stability under (hydro)thermal conditions [28,29]. As shown in Fig. 2 d, it is concluded that the HNSs with tunable mesoporous and high crystallinity have been synthesized successfully in this work. All in all, lysine plays an important role in the oriented aggregation of NASPs to form 2D-zeolite nanosheets as well as the in-situ formation of tunable mesopores in MFI zeolites. Notably, the aspect ratios and mesopore volumes of MFI zeolite nanosheets could be modulated through deliberately tuning the molar content of lysine in the synthesis mixture.",
          "Based on above results, it could be concluded that the successful synthesis of 2D-MFI zeolites is dependent on the decoupling nucleation-crystallization method, resulting from the synergy of a low temperature nucleation process and a lysine-assisted crystallization approach. And the representative HNSs (HNS-L0.5) were synthesized via amino acid assisted conversion through NASPs (P-50(12)) using the synthesis mixture of 1 SiO2: 0.14 TPAOH: 0.13 NaOH: 0.5 lysine: 50 H2O. The TEM image in Fig. 2 e shows the plate-like morphology of the HNS-L0.5. In addition, the in-situ formation of mesoporous (yellow circles) could be clearly observed in HNS-L0.5 (Fig. 2 e, f). Besides, the high-magnification TEM image reveals the well-defined lattice fringes (Fig. 2 g), and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 2 g) corroborates the single-crystalline nature of HNS-L0.5. The high crystallinity of the single crystalline HNS-L0.5 is also illustrated by 29Si NMR spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2 h. The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum could be divided into two peaks centered at ca. −115 and −102 ppm, respectively, which are assigned to Q4 = [Si-(OSi)4] and Q3 = [Si(OSi)3(OH)], respectively [36]. The high Q4/Q3 value (11.9) further confirms the highly crystalline and less defects properties of HNS-L0.5. Besides, the Si(OSi)3(OH) relates with the internal silanol, originated from the mesopores in HNS-L0.5."

          "As mentioned, the preparation of the NASPs in the nucleation process plays an important role in regulating the morphologies of MFI zeolites. The typical synthesis mixture of 1 SiO2: 0.13 NaOH: 0.14 TPAOH: 4.76 H2O for the synthesis of NASPs was used in the last section. Herein, the effect of NaOH in the nucleation stage was further studied, keeping the crystallization conditions all the same. Figure S9 a-c shows the SEM images of the synthesized zeolite samples. All the samples exhibit MFI-type zeolite with high crystallinity according to the XRD patterns ( Figure S9 d), and corresponding crystal sizes are presented in Table S2 . In a NaOH-free synthesis, HNS-N0-T0.14 shows a 3D bulk morphology ( Figure S9 a). When the TPAOH/SiO2 ratio increases to 0.27, HNS-N0-T0.27 exhibits reduced crystal size than HNS-N0-T0.14 and shows plate-like shape. This result indicates that a high alkalinity (OH–) is beneficial for nucleation, which reduces the crystal size of zeolites. However, the crystal size of HNS-L0.5 (=HNS-N0.13-T0.14) is much lower than HNS-N0-T0.27 although the alkalinity is similar, demonstrating that Na+ facilitates the rate of nucleation in the NASPs synthesis. It is confirmed by the fact that HNS-NaCl0.13-T0.27 exhibits reduced crystal size along all directions than that of HNS-N0-T0.27 ( Table S2 ). Therefore, the addition of NaOH can not only reduce the amount of TPAOH, but also promote nucleation in the nucleation process.",
          "To investigate the evolution process during the nucleation period, samples (P-50(t)) nucleated at 50 °C with different periods were characterized in detail (Fig. 3 ). Amorphous nanoparticles with irregular morphology could be observed from TEM images of P-50(t = 6–24 h) and no obvious subcrystals with uniform lattice structure were found in P-50(t = 6–12 h) (Fig. 3 a-c). XRD patterns probe the amorphous phase during the nucleation process (Fig. 3 f). Importantly, the Raman and FT-IR spectra reveal the presence of secondary building units (SBUs). As shown in Fig. 3 g, the Raman bands associated with the characteristic vibrations of the MFI zeolite framework (310 cm−1 & 335 cm−1 for single 6 MR, 375 cm−1 for 5 MR and 475 cm−1 & 516 cm−1 for 4 MR units in the crystal phase) appear in Raman spectra [37,38]. Additionally, the intensity of band at 550 cm−1 assigned to 5 MR of MFI framework in FT-IR spectra enhance with the increase of nucleation time (Fig. 3 h) [15,39]. Based on above analysis, NASPs could be regarded as a mixture of amorphous silica species (ASs) and SBUs or nuclei species, which is nucleated amorphous precursors of zeolite for initiating zeolite crystallization.",
          "Notably, subcrystals (∼3 nm) could be observed from the TEM images of P-50(24) (Fig. 3 d, e), indicating more nuclei produced in this period. However, the length dimension of the zeolite nanosheets grown from P-50(24) has significantly decreased (Table 1). This result indicates that the concentration of the SBUs or nuclei in NASPs significantly affects zeolite morphology. Then the effects of the concentration of the SBUs or nuclei in NASPs were investigated by adjusting the water content in the synthesis mixture (1 SiO2: 0.13 NaOH: 0.14 TPAOH: 0.5 lysine: y H2O (y = 15, 30, 50, 100, 200). As shown in Figures S10 & S11, Table S3 , when the H2O/SiO2 ratio changes from 15 to 200, the aspect ratio ((Lc + La )/Lb ) of the zeolite nanosheet (HNS-Hy) increases from 10.7 to 24.2. Notably, HNS-Hy samples show similar lengths along both a- and b-axis directions (300 nm along the a-axis and 70 nm along the b-axis), but quite different lengths along the c-axis direction (ca. 500, 600, 900, 1000 and 1200 nm, respectively). The high aspect ratio demonstrates that the attachment of the NASPs along the c-axis direction is more energetically favorable. Under high nuclei concentrations (the NASPs formed at higher nucleation temperature and longer nucleation time (e.g., 50 °C for 24 h, 60 °C for 6 h), lower water content in the synthesis mixture (e.g., H2O/SiO2 = 15)), the NASPs interact in close proximity, and thus the particle attachment event is accelerated, which leads to a rapid formation of a large amount of small-sized nanosheet intermediates at the initial growth stage. As a result, fewer ASs are left for nourishing the growth along the c-axis direction, leading to a lower aspect ratio. In contrast, at low NASPs concentrations, the collision probability of NASPs decreases, thereby reducing the particle attachment, resulting in the formation of relatively fewer nanosheets intermediates in the initial stage. Therefore, sufficient ASs are left for the growth along the c-axis direction."

          "Additionally, the formation of mesopores in HNSs has been further investigated. Firstly, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and molecular electrostatic potential map (MEP) of lysine were calculated based on the DFT method, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The distributions of LUMO are mainly centered carboxyl groups, and the positive area also focuses on carboxyl groups derived from MEP analysis. It means that carboxyl groups are the most susceptible area for nucleophilic attacks with anionic silicate species, responsible for the formation of mesopores in zeolite nanosheets [40]. Moreover, the results from N2 adsorption–desorption, FT-IR spectra and TG measurements for the uncalcined HNS-L0.5 zeolites (Fig. 4 b-d) imply that there are two kinds of mesopores in hierarchical zeolite nanosheets: one is attributed to the crystal defects resulting from the nucleophilic attack of lysine during the oriented attachment of NASPs, and the other is resulted from the lysine embedded in zeolites. As shown in Figure S12 a, b and Table S4 , the washed HNS-L0.5 without calcination exhibits defective mesopore volume of 0.08 cm3 g−1, and the mesoporous structure centering at about 2.9, 4.5 and 9.4 nm as observed in Figure S12 b. Notably, the HNS-L0.5 after calcination exhibits an improved mesopore volume of 0.17 cm3 g−1. Besides, the intensity centering at above 4.0 nm decreases ( Figure S12 d), indicating abundant small mesopores (<4 nm) appear after calcination. The result confirms the existence of secondary mesoporous structures attributed to the filling role of the lysine template agents. Moreover, the band related to C = O proves the existence of lysine in uncalcined HNS-L0.5 zeolites (Fig. 4 b), and the elemental analysis ( Table S5 ) reveals that lysine molecules exist in the HNS-L0.5 zeolites. The above-described analyses provide valuable insights into the induction effect of lysine to form the mesoporous structures, in which the complexation occurs between lysine and silicon species through the H-bonding [13]. As displayed in Fig. 4 c, HNS-L0 shows a constant mass loss from 50 °C to 500 °C, two exothermic DTG peaks (centered at 380 °C and 445 °C) are observed in Fig. 4 d, which are attributed to the decomposition of TPA+ in silicate frameworks. HNS-L0.5 exhibits obvious mass loss from 350 °C to 500 °C in Fig. 4 c, which results from the decomposition of TPA+ and lysine. Notably, the peak positions of the exothermic peaks of HNS-L0.5 shift toward higher temperature in comparison with HNS-L0 (Fig. 4 d). Compared with the TG result of lysine (Fig. 4 c), the exothermic DTG peak at 550 °C could be related with the decomposition of lysine. Above results provide additional evidence of the embeddedness of the lysine in the HNSs again."

          "Furthermore, the intermediates of HNS-L0.5 zeolite nanosheets at different crystallization times were investigated by TEM to further elucidate the crystallization process. Herein, the samples obtained at different crystallization temperatures and times are named as HNS-L0.5-T2(t2), in which T2 and t2 represent crystallization temperature and time, respectively. Note that, in the initial crystallization stage, an appreciable number of nanosheets (240 nm × 160 nm × 30 nm) are scattered among the high concentration of NASPs in HNS-L0.5–160(1) ( Figure S13 ) although the XRD pattern shows that HNS-L0.5–160(1) is amorphous ( Figure S14 a). Based on the intensity of the XRD peaks at 23.0°, 23.3°, 23.7°, 23.9° and 24.3°, the relative crystallinity of the sample was calculated (the crystallinity of HNS-L0.5–160(72) was set as 100 %). Rapidly, the zeolite nanosheets are formed with increased zeolite crystallinity after crystallization for only 2 h (relative crystallinity: 86 %, Figure S14 b; crystal size: 0.70 μm × 0.3 μm × 60 nm, Table S6 ), indicating a very fast kinetic attachment of NASPs. However, the fast crystallization process at 160 °C makes it difficult to illustrate the formation mechanism of HNSs. Therefore, HNS-L0.5–120(t2) samples are expected to provide more details during a slowed evolution process. As shown in Table S6 , for the crystallization time of 4 h, the decrease of the crystallization temperature from 160 to 120 °C resulted in a decrease in the crystal size in c-axis from 0.75 to 0.38 μm, while the length along a-axis only decreased from 0.30 to 0.26 μm and the length along the b-axis did not show obvious change. Namely, the crystallization temperature has no significant impact on the b-axis thickness. As anticipated, the precursor gel rapidly condenses and forms high short-range ordering amorphous species in the early-stage, where the subcrystals are encapsulated (Fig. 5 a, b). More specifically, the corresponding HRTEM image shows that the intermediates HNS-L0.5–120(t2) (t2 = 1, 2) are composed of ∼ 3 nm crystal domains and exhibit the poor lattice fringes ( Figure S15 ). Moreover, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis gives sparse diffraction spots, and inverse Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) images of HRTEM image index to the (1000) crystal planes of MFI zeolite ( Figure S15 ). As crystallization proceeds to 3 h, the nanosheet-like zeolites with irregular and rough edges are formed, and amorphous − crystalline interfaces are observed (Fig. 5 c, d). It is inferred that ASs directly and orientally attach to the crystalline subcrystal surfaces with the generation of amorphous − crystalline interfaces, followed by interface elimination and structural evolution into single crystalline phase. Finally, after hydrothermal treatment of 4 h (Fig. 5 e, f), the HNS-L0.5–120(4) exhibits regular hexagonal prism morphology with uniform particle size and high crystallinity ( Figure S16 ), demonstrating the highly complete structural evolution.",
          "Previous study demonstrates that the (010) surface in MFI zeolites is the most energetically favorable orientation among the three orientations during the additive-assisted synthesis [20]. Generally speaking, the preferred adsorption of the additives on the (010) surface can suppress the growth of MFI crystals along the b-orientation, leading to a nanosheet morphology. Therefore, the adsorption effect of lysine is responsible for the growth of zeolite nanosheets. To further illustrate the preferred adsorption effect of lysine, the zeolite nanosheets grown from the P-50(12) in the synthesis mixture 1 SiO2: 0.13 NaOH: 0.14 TPAOH: 0.5 lysine: 50 H2O under dynamic condition (160 °C 72 h, 30 rpm) were prepared, giving rise to the formation of HNS-L0.5-D ( Figure S17 ). Compared with HNS-L0.5, HNS-L0.5-D displayed a reduced particle size (700 nm × 300 nm × 90 nm) with a thicker length along b-axis, i.e., (Lc + La )/Lb decreased significantly, whose morphology was similar with HNS-L0.4, indicating that the dynamic condition weakens the preferred adsorption effect of lysine. This result further reveals the critical adsorption effect of lysine on the kinetic regulation of zeolite growth. Additionally, the adsorption effect for the formation of zeolite nanosheets is not only specific to lysine but also works with other types of amino acids, e.g. glycine ( Figure S18 )."

          "Taking the above results into consideration, Fig. 5 g illustrates the proposed growth mechanism of the single-crystalline HNSs through amino acid-assisted conversion of NASPs via a decoupling nucleation-crystallization method. The successful synthesis depends on two crucial factors including the facile fabrication of the NASPs and the lysine-assisted crystallization approach. That is, the evolution process could be decoupled into two steps: I): nucleation at low temperature and II): crystal growth at high temperature. Firstly, the NASPs, a mixture of SBUs, crystal nuclei and amorphous TPA+-silicate species, are formed after the low-temperature nucleation process. In this stage, a broad synthesis window is achievable, e.g., nucleation temperature: 30–60 °C accompanied with nucleation time: 6–48 h. In the subsequent crystallization period after the introduction of lysine aqueous solution, crystal nuclei grow into nanocrystals, and then rapid oriented attachment of the ASs to nanocrystals takes place through a nonclassical crystallization route due to the preferred adsorption effect of lysine on growth kinetics [41]. After coalescence in ripening process, the crystal shape evolves from irregular morphology into hexagonal prism, thus the single-crystalline HNSs are successfully synthesized. Specially, the crystal defects arising from the nucleophilic attacks of lysine evolve into partial mesopores during the oriented attachment of NASPs [42,43], and the removal of the lysine embedded in the nanosheets induce to additional mesopores. Based on the mass ratio of calcined zeolite to the raw material (solid silica), the calculated yield of the synthesized HNS-L0.5 was above 95 %. Overall, the successful synthetic route could provide a general strategy for the formation of single-crystalline HNSs."

          "Considering that the hierarchical nanosheets HNS-L0.5 have excellent pore structure parameters and thin thickness in b-axis, we applied it to the evaluation for dye adsorption. In this work, rhodamine B (RhB), as one of the important water pollution sources, was selected as the target of adsorption study. For comparison, the adsorption performance of the conventional coffin-shaped silicalite-1 (MFI) zeolites (denoted as CS-1, Figure S19 ) was investigated. As shown in Figure S19 c, the CS-1 exhibits a lower mesoporous volume of 0.05 cm3 g−1 than HNS-L0.5. Fig. 6 a, b shows the adsorption isotherms and dynamic adsorption curves of HNS-L0.5 and CS-1 for RhB dye adsorptions. Obviously, HNS-L0.5 exhibits both higher adsorption capability and faster adsorption rate than CS-1. For example, at the initial concentration of RhB 20 mg L-1, the adsorption capacity of HNS-L0.5 is 20.34 mg g−1 within equilibrium adsorption time of 120 min, which is almost twice as much as that of CS-1 (11.50 mg g−1, equilibrium adsorption time: 180 min). In addition, HNS-L0.5 exhibits the maximum adsorption capacity of 115.7 mg g−1 according to the Langmuir model. The Freundlich model is more suitable for characterizing the equilibrium data than Langmuir model, indicating the multiple layers adsorption of RhB (Fig. 6 c, d, Table 3 ) [44].",
          "Furthermore, the adsorption rate k (derived from pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitting, Fig. 6 e, f, Table 4 ) and maximum uptake of HNS-L0.5 reaches as high as 0.0160 g mg−1 min−1 and 20.48 mg g−1, which are higher than those of CS-1, respectively and the HNS-L0.5 exhibits better adsorption performance than previously reported zeolite adsorbents ( Table S7 ).",
          "The above results show that HNS-L0.5 is a perfect adsorbent with both fast adsorption kinetics and high capacities to remove dyes, confirming its superiority in mass transferring and adsorption capacity. Moreover, the adsorption process is endothermic because of that the adsorption capacity increases with the adsorption temperature (Fig. 6 g). Notably, the pH value of the RhB solution has a significant effect on the adsorption performance. As shown in Figure S20 , the adsorption capacity decreases with the increase of pH value. At a lower pH, RhB remain as monomeric molecules, leading to a fast adsorption for HNS-L0.5. In contrast, RhB undergoes a transformation into a zwitterionic form when the pH reaches to an alkaline value [45]. The transformation promotes the aggregation of RhB molecules, resulting in the decrease of adsorption capacity [44]. More importantly, there is no obvious change in crystal structure after adsorption according to the XRD patterns (Fig. 6 h). And after three consecutive adsorption–regeneration cycles, the adsorption capacity could remain about 97 % (Fig. 6 i), further demonstrating good thermal stability of HNS-L0.5. Overall, the excellent adsorption performance of HNS-L0.5 could be attributed to its abundant mesopores and short diffusion length along b-axis in the zeolite nanosheets and its high hydrothermal stability."

          "In summary, a facile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of single-crystalline HNSs with tunable mesopores and morphologies. Moreover, the prepared HNSs possess high crystallinity, less defects and high hydrothermal stability. This successful synthesis is achievable through the particular oriented aggregation of the NASPs by a lysine-assisted approach in a decoupling nucleation-crystallization process. Specially, during the aggregation process, the nucleophilic attacks of lysine on the defective framework silicon sites lead to partial mesopores. Besides, the lysine embedded in the zeolite nanosheets leads to the formation of another mesopores. Importantly, the hierarchical zeolite nanosheets exhibit higher adsorption capability and faster adsorption thanks to the abundant mesopores and short diffusion length along b-axis in the zeolite nanosheets. In addition, the amino acid assistant approach may open a new route to kinetically regulate the controllable mesopore volumes and morphologies in high-quality hierarchical zeolites for high-performance in catalysis, adsorption and separation applications."

In this work, SAPO-34 zeolite (SAPO-34-S-F) featuring both significantly reduced crystal dimension and a hierarchical structure was synthesized for the first time through a seed-assisted strategy employing cost-effective triethylamine (TEA) as the only organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) in the NH4F-containing medium. The resulting SAPO-34 zeolite demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance in methanol-to-olefin (MTO) reaction, exhibiting a substantially increased catalytic lifetime of 525 min as well as an impressive light olefin selectivity of up to 83.7 %. These results significantly outperform those of conventional SAPO-34 zeolite with larger crystal dimension synthesized using TEA as OSDA, and SAPO-34 zeolite with similar crystal dimension synthesized without fluoride addition. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the spent catalysts revealed that SAPO-34-S-F possesses enhanced coke tolerance. Furthermore, in situ UV/Vis studies of the organic intermediates generated on zeolites during MTO reaction provided additional evidence for the excellent catalytic activity and stability of the SAPO-34-S-F sample. These findings offer important insights for the rational development of stable and high-efficiency SAPO-34 zeolite for MTO reaction.",

          "Nowadays, over 40 % of solid catalysts in the chemical industry are mainly derived from zeolite materials [1]. The outstanding catalytic properties of zeolites arises from their well-ordered pore channel systems, modulable active sites, high thermal/hydrothermal stability. Among various zeolites, SAPO-34 zeolite contains a CHA cage (9.4 Å) connected with three-dimensional eight-ring intersecting channels (0.38 Å × 0.38 Å) [2], which has garnered significant interest because of its exceptional catalytic performance in MTO reaction. In particular, SAPO-34 zeolite has demonstrated exceptional performance as a catalyst for ethylene and propylene production, providing a viable alternative for producing light olefins from non-petroleum resources, which addresses the ever-growing global demand for light olefins [3–5]. However, the narrow pore dimension as well as large CHA cage of the microporous SAPO-34 zeolite often leads to severe diffusion limitations, consequently, a rapid catalyst deactivation often occur owing to the rapid deposition of coke species and pore blocking [6,7].",
          "Accordingly, the development of highly efficient SAPO-34 zeolites with enhanced stability is crucial for MTO reaction, garnering significant attention and research interest in the field. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing the SAPO-34 stability in catalyzing MTO process through various approaches. These methods typically involve modifying the morphology or structure of the zeolite crystals, such as reducing zeolite crystal size to shorten diffusion pathways or establish a hierarchical structure [8,9]. To prepare SAPO-34 zeolite with greatly reduced crystal size, a typical OSDA of TEAOH is usually used, however, the high cost of TEAOH poses a major obstacle to its widespread use [10,11]. To address this issue, there is a growing need for cheap and easy-available OSDAs that can facilitate the production of SAPO-34 with reduced crystal dimension. Up to now, several low-cost OSDAs have been successfully applied to prepare SAPO-34 zeolite, ie. Triethylamine [12], morpholine [13], n-butylamine [14], etc. However, these OSDAs often yield SAPO-34 zeolite crystals larger than 5 μm, which are detrimental to the MTO reaction. Therefore, fabricating SAPO-34 zeolites with reduced crystal dimension by the above low-cost OSDAs garnered significant interest from both academic and industrial communities. Moreover, hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites have exhibited the ability to alleviate mass transport limitations, minimize coke formation as well as enhance catalytic performance in MTO reaction. Recently, various approaches have been developed to synthesize this type materials, including soft-templating methods [15–17], hard-templating methods [18] as well as post-treatment method [19–21]. However, these approaches often involve complex procedures and expensive reagents, limiting their application. Hence, it's crucial to develop straightforward and economical approaches for the synthesis of hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites.",
          "Fluorine anion is widely recognized as crucial mineralizing agent in zeolite synthesis field [22,23]. Fluoride tends to reduce supersaturation of the species forming the framework, as a result, a distinctive feature of fluoride-mediated zeolite synthesis is the significantly slow nucleation rate, which often leads to the formation of larger crystals [24–26]. In addition, another significant characteristic of zeolites synthesized using fluoride-assisted method is that the resulting zeolite crystals typically exhibit fewer defect sites. This characteristic can enhance the zeolite's hydrophobic properties and improve its resistance to coke formation, thereby contributing to greater catalytic efficiency and stability [27–29]. However, the large zeolite crystal prepared in the fluoride media will lead to severe diffusion limitations, restricting its application in catalytic reactions. To circumvent this drawback, several approaches have been proposed, ie., introducing zeolite seeds or incorporating an initial aging step prior to fluoride addition. [30–33], the two strategies both aim to increase zeolite crystal growth rate through increasing the nuclei number during synthesis, ultimately reducing zeolite crystal dimension.",
          "To our knowledge, the preparation of SAPO-34 zeolites featuring both significantly reduced crystal size and a hierarchical structure using cost-effective OSDAs in a fluoride-containing medium has not been previously reported. Herein, SAPO-34 zeolite catalysts with greatly reduced crystal size, hierarchical structure and fewer defect sites were successfully prepared through a seed-assisted approach, employing TEA as the sole OSDA in an NH4F-containing medium. The resulting SAPO-34 zeolite demonstrated significantly improved catalytic activity in MTO reaction, exhibiting a substantially increased catalytic lifetime as well as higher selectivity of C2H4 and C3H6, in comparison with conventional SAPO-34 zeolites with larger crystals prepared using the OSDA of TEA, as well as those with similar crystal sizes produced via a seed-assisted method. Additionally, the characteristics and behavior of carbonaceous deposits on SAPO-34 catalysts were analyzed using in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy, offering additional evidence of the improved catalytic properties."

Typically, Pseudo-boehmite was initially mixed with phosphoric acid as well as deionized water until a uniform solution was achieved. The TEA solution was then introduced into the mixture and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, colloidal silica was added into the obtained mixture and stirred for an additional 1 h. The calcined SAPO-34 zeolite seed was then added and stirred for 1 h. Finally, NH4F was introduced into the aforementioned mixture and stirred for 1 h. The mixture was subsequently transferred into an autoclave and subjected to crystallization at 200 °C for 2 days. After that, the product was thoroughly washed with deionized water until the pH approached near-neutral, which was then dried at 70 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. The resulting sample was denoted as SAPO-34-S-F, with S and F indicating that the sample was prepared using a seed-assisted method combined with fluoride addition. The detail procedures for the synthesis of SAPO-34 zeolite seeds, SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-C, the sample characterizations and catalytic evaluation were provided in the supplementary data."

          "As depicted in Fig. 1 , the XRD patterns of all samples (SAPO-34-C, SAPO-34-S, SAPO-34-S-F) exhibit distinct diffraction patterns of CHA-type zeolite with sharp and high-intensity peaks, indicating the successful formation of CHA-type zeolite with high crystallinity and phase purity via different synthesis routes.",
          "As exhibited in Fig. 2 , the SAPO-34-C synthesized by conventional method shows a typical cube-like morphology with crystal dimensions in the range of 10–20 μm. In contrast to the large zeolite crystal of SAPO-34-C, SAPO-34-S shows an average particle size of approximately 1 μm, which is more than 10-fold smaller than the sample SAPO-34-C. The remarkable reduction in crystal size should be assigned to the presence of zeolite seed species, which could serve as nuclei or facilitate secondary nuclei formation, thereby promoting the production of significantly smaller zeolite crystals. Furthermore, the sample SAPO-34-S-F synthesized via a seed-assisted approach combined with fluoride addition exhibits much more uniform zeolite particle size of about 1 μm. The corresponding zeolite crystal dimension is greatly decreased compared with the zeolite crystals obtained in conventional fluoride-containing medium, which typically exceed 10 μm in size [25]. The results further indicate that the zeolite seeds can effectively reducing the crystal dimension of the zeolite products yielded in a fluoride-containing medium. What's more, some holes can be clearly found on the zeolite crystal surface of SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F, the holes occur on SAPO-34-S should be owing to the in-situ dissolution of the added seeds and thus generate the holes [34]. Obviously, more holes appeared on SAPO-34-S-F (Fig. 2), this should be due to the chemical etching effect of NH4F [35–37]. Moreover, high crystallinity of SAPO-34 zeolite can still be obtained by this in-situ etching strategy, implying that in-situ etching can maintain the high crystallinity of zeolite, which is totally in contrast to the post-treatment route. TEM was further employed to shed more light on SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F. Clearly, the sample SAPO-34-S-F possesses more pores within the size range of 10–200 nm compared to the sample SAPO-34-S (Fig. S1 and Fig S2), indicating that the seed-assisted approach combined with fluoride addition is a more effective route to introduce mesopore and macropore into SAPO-34 zeolite crystals. Hence, the SEM and TEM images clearly manifest that the combined approach of seed-assisted and fluoride-assisted methods proves highly effective in minimizing zeolite crystal dimension as well as fabricating hierarchical structure within zeolite crystals. Furthermore, the pure phase SAPO-34 zeolite seed (Fig. S3) exhibits an average particle dimension of 1 μm (Fig. S4).",
          "As shown in Fig. 3 , both the samples SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F show an obvious uptake near saturation pressure in the isotherms compared with the sample SAPO-34-C, implying the occurrence of meso- or macropores. Moreover, the samples SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F exhibit nearly identical micropore as SAPO-34-C (Table 1 ), revealing that all the zeolite samples have similar crystallinity. Furthermore, the SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F samples demonstrate an enhancement in the external surface area as well as mesopore volume, further confirming that a secondary porosity was successfully introduced into the zeolite samples.",
          "As shown in Table 1, no substantial change was observed in the compositions of different zeolite samples. Notably, the results further demonstrate that fluoride etching is an unbiased process, which is in line with previous reports [38–40]. The acidity properties of the series of zeolite samples were investigated by NH3-TPD (Fig. 4 ). All samples exhibited characteristic desorption peaks, centered at low and high temperatures, corresponding to weak and strong acid sites in the SAPO-34 zeolite samples, respectively. Meanwhile, the peak intensities are nearly identical for all samples, indicating that the zeolite samples have similar acid concentration. However, a noticeable difference in the peak locations of strong acid sites was observed among the three samples. The desorption temperatures for SAPO-34-C, SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F were 500 °C, 485 °C and 455 °C, respectively. As a higher desorption temperature suggests an increase of the acid strength, therefore, the acid strength of the three samples follow the sequence: SAPO-34-C > SAPO-34-S > SAPO-34-S-F.",
          "The solid-state MAS NMR was employed to investigate the local structure of Si, Al and P in zeolite samples. As shown in 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 5 a), all samples display three signals located at ∼43, 15 and −10 ppm, which are corresponding to aluminum atoms in tetrahedral coordination within the framework, as well as those in pentacoordinated and hexacoordinated states [41]. A dominant signal located at −27 ppm can be found in 31P MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 5b), which is owing to the tetrahedrally coordinated P in SAPO-34 zeolite. Meanwhile, a weak shoulder signal at −15 ppm can be found in all samples. This signal is assigned to P coordinated with water molecules [42,43]. What's more, no obvious difference can be found in both the 27Al MAS NMR and 31P MAS NMR spectra, indicating that the addition of zeolite seeds or fluoride has no obvious effects on the Al or P coordination in SAPO-34 zeolite samples. However, an apparent difference can be observed in 29Si MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 5c). The SAPO-34-C and SAPO-34-S zeolite samples display a prominent peak at −90 ppm, which is corresponding to Si(0Si, 4Al) [44]. While a dominant signal at −95 ppm attributed to the Si (1Si, 3Al) species is found in 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the sample SAPO-34-S-F [45]. It is widely accepted that the incorporation of Si through the SM2 mechanism produce Si(0Si, 4Al)], whereas the SM3 mechanism produces other configurations [46]. As indicated by the 29Si MAS NMR spectra, the dominant Si incorporation mechanism in the SAPO-34-C and SAPO-34-S samples is through SM2 route. However, when fluoride is introduced into the synthesis system, the SM3 route becomes the primary pathway. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of fluoride effectively alters the silicon incorporation pathway, shifting the dominant mechanism from SM2 to SM3. Furthermore, broad shoulder peaks in the range of −78 to −85 ppm are observed in SAPO-34-C and SAPO-34-S. These peaks are assigned to (Si(OT)n (OH)4-n), resulting from the partial dissociation of Si–OH–Al bonds [47,48]. However, this peak is absence from the 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the sample SAPO-34-S-F, indicating that the fluoride addition can effectively reduce the defects sites in zeolite, aligning with earlier findings reported in the literature [28,29].",
          "To evaluate the coke resistance of the samples, TGA analysis was performed on spent catalysts. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the weight loss occurring below 200 °C is attributed to the release of adsorbed water molecules, while the weight loss between 200 and 800 °C is due to the thermal decomposition of coke deposits trapped within zeolite samples. The weight loss of the coke compounds for samples SAPO-34-C, SAPO-34-S and SAPO-34-S-F is 15.2 %, 16.2 % and 17.2 %, respectively. To directly assess the coke resistance of various SAPO-34 zeolites during MTO reaction, the average coke accumulation rate (Rcoke) was further calculated. As shown in Fig. 8b, both SAPO-34-S-F and SAPO-34-S exhibit a much lower Rcoke than SAPO-34-C (0.040/0.065 vs 0.131 mg/min), indicating that a much better coke tolerance of SAPO-34-S-F and SAPO-34-S. The introduction of meso/macro pores and the decrease of the zeolite crystal dimension can effectively enhance the diffusion efficiency, and substantially reduce coke accumulation, thereby enhancing the performance of SAPO-34 zeolite in MTO reaction.",
          "In situ UV/vis spectroscopy was employed to get more details of the evolution of organic species formed over different zeolite samples during MTO reaction. As shown in Fig. 9 , the band at ∼300 nm quickly emerged during the early stages of MTO reaction, indicating the formation of monoenylic carbenium ions [52]. With time on stream, the intensity of this band is gradually declined and a new band located at ∼325 nm due to dienylic carbenium ions occurred [53]. Meanwhile, a new band at ∼270 nm owing to the polyalkylaromatics can also be observed [54]. Besides, a band at ∼400–410 nm, associated with polycyclic aromatic compounds, is observed in all catalysts, and its intensity progressively increases with prolonged reaction time [6]. The concentrations of polycyclic aromatics can be reflected by the band intensity, as shown in Fig. 9, one can conclude that the accumulation rate of polycyclic aromatics is variable among the zeolite samples and follows the sequence: SAPO-34-C > SAPO-34-S > SAPO-34-S-F. The quick accumulation of polycyclic aromatics of sample SAPO-34-C should be owing to the much longer diffusion pathway in the large zeolite crystal, which could result in significantly hindered-diffusion effect and thus improve the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics. Downsizing the crystal dimension of the zeolite sample can effectively reduce the diffusion pathway, hence, a much lower coke accumulation rate can be observed on the sample SAPO-34-S. The notably slower coke accumulation rate in the SAPO-34-S-F sample should be ascribed to its smaller crystal dimension and the incorporation of meso/macro pores. Besides, the shortage of defect sites and the reduced acid strength of the sample SAPO-34-S-F may also contribute to the lower coke accumulation rate. What's more, an exclusive band located at ∼475 nm is found in the sample SAPO-34-C, which is assigned to the species of trienylic carbenium ions [55]. The result further confirms that long diffusion pathway will promote the conversion towards more complex coke compounds and accelerate the deactivation of the zeolite. Therefore, these findings provide a clear explanation for the variations in catalytic stability among the three samples, which is in line with the catalytic activity (Figs. 6 and 7) and TGA results (Fig. 8).",
          "Generally, polycyclic aromatic compounds are the main coke species formed in SAPO-34 catalysts during MTO reaction, which are meanly generated from the hydrogen transfer reaction between primary olefins and trapped methylbenzenes/methylnaphthalenes [56]. Therefore, the hydrogen transfer reaction is regarded as a key factor contributing to the rapid catalyst deactivation. A lower HTI index corresponds to slower catalyst deactivation. Herein, the hydrogen transfer index (HTI, C3H8/C3H6) was utilized to assess the level of hydrogen transfer reactions. As shown in Fig. 10 , the HTI index value of the samples SAPO-34-S-F and SAPO-34-S are lower than the conventional SAPO-34 sample. Notably, a 2.5-fold decreased initial HTI value was observed on the sample SAPO-34-S-F, which is well consistent with the catalyst stability of the samples. The results further confirm that the sample SAPO-34-S-F can well suppress the formation of the polycyclic aromatics, thereby minimizing coke formation during MTO reaction and significantly improving catalytic stability. The results are in line with the findings discussed above."

          "In summary, hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites were successfully fabricated by using TEA as OSDA, via a seed-assisted approach combined with fluoride addition. The resultant zeolite sample SAPO-34-S-F exhibits an identical zeolite particle size (∼1 μm) as the zeolite sample SAPO-34-S produced by seed-assisted approach, which is significantly reduced compared with the sample SAPO-34-C (∼10–20 μm) obtained with TEA as OSDA. Additionally, the zeolite sample SAPO-34-S-F exhibits fewer defect sites as well as lower acid strength than the samples SAPO-34-C and SAPO-34-S. Due to the improved transport efficiency, reduced defect sites and lower acid strength, the zeolite SAPO-34-S-F demonstrates exceptional performance in MTO reactions. It exhibits a 4-fold increase in catalytic lifetime (525 min), a 2.5-fold decreased HTI value and more than 6 % increased selectivity of light olefins compared with SAPO-34-C. What's more, a much lower average coke accumulation rate was observed on the sample SAPO-34-S-F (Rcoke = 0.04 mg/min), which is obviously reduced compared with samples SAPO-34-C (Rcoke = 0.131 mg/min) and SAPO-34-S (Rcoke = 0.065 mg/min). Finally, in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy investigation further verified the enhanced catalytic properties of SAPO-34-S-F. This work demonstrates a facile and cost-effective strategy for fabricating SAPO-34 zeolites with greatly improved MTO performance, which may bring new opportunities to develop efficient SAPO zeolites for catalytic applications."

    "abstract": "The Ni/Beta zeolite has been recognized as a promising catalyst for olefin oligomerization, though its catalytic activity and stability still confront significant challenges. In this work, the alkaline/acid treatment is employed to inducibly regulate the acid center and cationic Ni coordination environment in hierarchical Ni/Beta catalysts. Notably, this modification modulates the framework Al species, transitioning them to an extra-framework state, which intensifies the electron deficiency of Ni cations and consequently boosts their catalytic activities. These cations in the modified sample, acting as active species, exhibit an elevated reaction rate of 182.1 molC3=/(molNi·h), up from 151.3 molC3=/(molNi·h), while maintaining a dimer selectivity of 69.1 %. In addition, the optimally desilicated Ni/DSB(5.5) sample exhibits a larger mesoporous volume (0.943 cm3/g) compared to the untreated Ni/Beta(12) (0.734 cm3/g), facilitating faster product desorption and diffusion, ultimately prolonging catalyst lifetime. The generation of secondary mesopores significantly reduces the catalyst deactivation rate from 0.0663 h-1 to 0.0109 h-1 during operation. This strategy successfully enhances the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/Beta catalyst for propylene dimerization. The comparative analyses involving Al-containing and Al-free catalysts further underscore the crucial role of various Al states on the Ni active species. This study presents an approach for the development of highly efficient and long-term stable catalysts for olefin oligomerization.",

          "The dimerization of light olefins, such as propylene, is an attractive route for the synthesis of high-value products, such as oil additives, plasticizers, sulfur-free transportation fuels and fine chemicals [1–5]. In recent years, the heterogeneous system has garnered escalating attention in comparison to its homogeneous counterpart, primarily due to its environmental friendliness and cost-competitiveness. However, the conventional solid acid catalysts are frequently plagued by issues of corrosion and deactivation, and a pronounced propensity towards undesired larger oligomers and aromatics compromising the selectivity [6]. To overcome these limitations, the incorporation of isolated nickel into solid acid catalysts has been explored as a means to introduce a novel active center, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic activity and dimer selectivity under mild conditions [7].",
          "Ni-based aluminosilicates, particularly those possessing highly structured microporous zeolites, have exhibited remarkable efficiency as dimerization catalysts and have been widely investigated. Within the zeolite framework, Ni2+ cations serving as charge compensators are dispersed by the support where the dimerization reaction occurs. Nevertheless, a major challenge faced by these microporous materials is their rapid deactivation. This deactivation is primarily attributed to the formation of heavy oligomers, which frequently become entrapped within the pore system, thereby limiting their industrial applications. Taking Ni/Beta zeolite as an example, although a high dimer yield is achieved, the catalytic activity rapidly declines with time on stream. To improve mass transfer, various strategies have been proposed, including the utilization of nanometric zeolites [8–10]. A proposed strategy to mitigate this issue involves decreasing the crystal size, which can effectively reduce the diffusion limitations of products and thereby enhance catalyst stability [9]. Nanocrystalline Ni-Beta, for instance, has been synthesized and exhibited significantly more stable activity compared to its microcrystalline counterpart in ethylene oligomerization. Furthermore, the creation of a hierarchical structure, characterized by the introduction of an additional mesoporous framework within the microporous zeolites, has been explored in various reactions such as cracking, aromatization, and isomerization [11–13]. This strategy for constructing mesoporous network in zeolites effectively facilitates intracrystalline transport and thus enhances catalytic stability [14]. The post-synthesis method is widely employed for creating a hierarchical zeolite system through post-treatment procedures in alkaline or acid solutions. Moon et al. applied alkaline-treated Ni/Beta and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts for ethylene and hexene oligomerization, achieving remarkable improvements in activity and stability compared to untreated counterparts [10]. Notably, these catalysts favored selectivity toward heavier hydrocarbons suitable for jet- or diesel-range fuels rather than dimerization. More recently, Mohamed et al. [15] reported a hierarchical Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst with exceptional productivity and stability for ethylene oligomerization, further validating the efficacy of hierarchical structuring. However, analogous studies on propylene dimerization remain limited.",
          "During the post-treatment process, the leaching of Si and Al atoms from zeolite framework results in the emergence of mesoporosity, concomitantly leading to significant changes in the hydroxyls of Si and Al species [16]. In our previous study, it was observed that these hydroxyl groups played a crucial role in determining the chemical state of Ni species, a factor closely linked to their catalytic activity [17]. Notably, the samples characterized by a diminished surface Si/Al ratio exhibited an improved reaction rate, yet the underlying mechanisms for this enhancement remained elusive. Therefore, the post-treatment modifications to the zeolite framework would offer a promising avenue for introducing alterations and facilitating a comprehensive study into both hydroxyl groups and Ni species, which is meaningful in elucidating their active states and catalytic attributes.",
          "In this study, we systematically regulate the zeolite framework using acid and alkaline treatment methods under various modification conditions. Our focus is on elucidating the effects of these modification treatments on both the pore structure and the coordination environment of Ni species. Furthermore, it is revealed that the intricate relationship between electronic state of Ni active center and catalytic activity of propylene dimerization. By optimally modifying the zeolite structure, the deactivation rate of catalyst is decreased by six folds (from 0.0663 h−1 to 0.0109 h−1). Meanwhile, highly dispersed and electron-poorer Ni2+ cations are created, which is be proven to be advantageous for propylene molecules to dimerize, exhibiting enhanced catalytic efficiency (from 151.3 to 182.1 molC3=/(molNi·h)). To our knowledge, this study represents an early investigation into Ni-based hierarchical catalysts for propylene dimerization. The findings from this approach may contribute to advancements in Ni/zeolite catalyst design and provide useful perspectives for future research on propylene oligomerization catalysts."

          "It is known that the post-treatments of zeolites within alkaline or acid solution will inevitably induce the framework destruction due to the atom dissolution [22]. Table S1 presents the elemental composition of the catalysts synthesized under different modification conditions. As anticipated, the framework structure of Beta zeolite is considerably impacted by different treatments, which ismanifested through the partial removal of silicon and aluminum atoms. The degree of removal intensifies as the treatment conditions grow more severe, resulting in a significant alteration of Si/Al ratio (SAR) ranging from 2.2 to 220.",
          "The structural damage degree of different modification treatments is further investigated by ATR-FTIR and XRD. The results in Fig. 1 (a) reveal that all the samples exhibit almost identical infrared spectra. The bands of the parent zeolite in the wavenumber range of 500 – 820 cm−1 are typically attributed to the fingerprint region of zeolites, representing the secondary structural unit of the framework [23]. The additional vibrational bands at 1228 cm−1 and 1062 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of the T–O bond in the five-membered ring and Si–O–T (T = Si or Al) bond, respectively [24]. A noteworthy observation is the gradual blueshift in vibrational bands with increasing SAR, also confirming the removal of Si and Al atoms from the zeolite frameworks under various treatments [23,25].",
          "Moreover, it is evident that the destructive effect on the zeolite framework structure varies significantly depending on the modification treatment. While acid treatment has a minimal impact on the structure, alkaline treatment results in a critical drop in infrared band intensity. For the Al-rich zeolites with SARs ranging from 5.2 to 8.8, the intensity of all bands gradually decreases. A more severe alkaline condition leads to the collapse of framework structure for the low-SAR sample (DSB(2.2)). One possible explanation for the contrasting effects of acid and alkaline treatments lies in the low Al content of the parent Beta zeolite.",
          "Consistently, XRD results also evidence significant structural changes during desilication. A comparison of the patterns of the desilicated samples with that of the parent Beta(12) zeolite in Fig. 1(b) shows that desilication leads to a partial amorphization of the crystal structure (*BEA, ICDD No. 47–0183), with the relative crystallinity (RC) values remaining 56 % for DSB(5.5). More seriously, the crystal structure is entirely lost after rigorous alkaline treatment for DSB(2.2). Compared to the alkaline treatment, acid treatment has a relatively lesser impact on the crystallinity of the zeolite. In the case of DAB(220), the RC value of the *BEA structure remains at 76 %, which is obviously higher than that of the alkaline-treated samples. Overall, these findings suggest that a significant proportion of the parent Beta zeolite framework structure can be preserved with appropriate modification conditions.",
          "Accordingly, alterations in the framework will give rise to the state transformation of Al or Si species. Notably, the impact is particularly significant in the case of Al species [26]. 27Al MAS NMR technique is employed to compare the coordination environments of aluminum species in the modified zeolites with the parent Beta(12). Expectedly, the modification results in a significant change in the spectra, as presented in Fig. 1(c). Two main peaks at chemical shifts of approximately 0 ppm and 55 ppm are displayed in all the samples, which are attributed to six-coordinated extra-framework aluminum (EFAl) and four-coordinated framework aluminum (FAl) species, respectively. Upon comparison with the parent Beta(12) zeolite, it is observed that the peak intensities of both EFAl and FAl species in all the modified samples decrease with increasing modification severity, suggesting that Al species are removed by both acid- and alkaline-treatments. This influence is more significant for EFAl species, which almost disappears in DSB(2.2) and DAB(107). Meanwhile, some disordered structures are formed as the result of the collapsed support structure, exhibiting a significantly broadened signal peak at 55 ppm in DSB(2.2) [27]. Surprisingly, for the mildly treated sample of DSB(5.5), an additional peak at approximately 30 ppm appears, indicating that five-coordinated aluminum species are generated and remain in the pore channels [28]. This observation is rationalized by considering that the chemical attack of low concentrations of hydroxyl anions preferentially occurs on Si extraction, leading to Al species being retained in a transformed state. The highest proportion of EFAl species in DSB(5.5) may stand a chance to contribute to a unique nature for this catalyst (Table S1).",
          "Furthermore, the state transformation of Si and Al atoms is also analyzed through FTIR spectra of hydroxyl groups, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The spectra display four main bands at 3777 cm−1, 3735 cm−1, 3654 cm−1, and 3600 cm−1. The most intense band at 3735 cm−1 is attributed to the internal Si-OH group [7,18]. Additionally, the bands appearing at 3777 cm−1, 3654 cm−1, and 3600 cm−1 can be distinguished and are related to Al species. The first two bands are attributed to the extra-framework Al-OH group, while the latter is attributed to the Si(OH)Al-bridged hydroxyl group [7,9,29]. Compared to the parent Beta(12) zeolite, a small number of Si-OH groups in DSB(2.2) and DAB(107) are preserved in a predominant state. Meanwhile, the weak bands related to EFAl species at 3777 cm−1 and 3654 cm−1 disappear, suggesting that the severe treatments lead to the significant removal of EFAl species. In the case of DSB(5.5), the band for the Si-OH group does not show a significant decrease in intensity but appears to be blueshifted, indicating that more outer-surface Si-OH groups are exposed after alkaline-treatment [7]. It is associated to the development of mesoporosity and may contribute to the exposure of more outer specific surface [30], which is beneficial to the reaction performance."

          "The effect of modification on the catalytic dimerization performance of Ni-based modified catalysts was evaluated through a comparative analysis with the untreated catalyst. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 2 (a), which demonstrates a significant enhancement in catalyst stability following the modification. Specifically, on the Ni/Beta(12) sample, a marked decrease in catalytic activity is observed over time on stream, with the propylene consumption rate diminishing from 151.3 molC3=/(molNi·h) to 91.2 molC3=/(molNi·h) within 6 h, namely, a high deactivation rate of 0.0663 h−1. However, in contrast, the deactivation rates on the modified catalysts, that is Ni/DSB(8.8), Ni/DSB(8.0), and Ni/DSB(5.5), are significantly reduced to 0.0521, 0.0269, and 0.0109 h−1, respectively. Prior research has identified the primary cause of deactivation in olefin oligomerization catalysts as the low rate of product diffusion and pore blockage [9,31,32]. Consequently, the observed improvement in stability for the low-SAR samples can be attributed to alterations in the support structure caused by modification.",
          "The decreases in SARs not only enhance the stability but also significantly boost the catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalysts. As the SAR of the support decreases from 12.0 to 5.5, the initial reaction rate gradually increases from 151.4 to 182.1 molC3=/(molNi·h). This trend suggests that the structural changes, such as the formation of EFAl species due to the removal of Si atoms, positively impact the activity of each Ni atom. However, excessive removal of Si atoms is disadvantageous. When the SAR is reduced to 5.2, the initial reaction rate of Ni/DSB(5.2) decreases to 161.4 molC3=/(molNi·h), while the deactivation rate increases to 0.0351 h−1. Furthermore, when the SAR is significantly reduced to 2.2, resulting in a severely destructed framework structure, Ni/DSB(2.2) exhibits almost negligible catalytic activity (reaction rate < 6.0 molC3=/(molNi·h)), comparable to that of Ni/Al2O3. This observation, combined with XRD results, reveals that the diffraction peaks attributed to the *BEA structure in DSB(2.2) are completely absent. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the zeolite framework structure plays a crucial role in maintaining the reactivity of the Ni sites.",
          "Upon comparison, a different result is observed in the high-SAR samples. As the SAR of samples is increased, a reduction in activity is evident, along with a deterioration in stability. Specifically, Ni/DAB(107) exhibits a reaction rate of 66.2 molC3=/(molNi·h), and meanwhile experiences a deactivation rate of 0.1667 h−1 that is 27 times higher than the unmodified sample (Ni/Beta(12), 0.0663 h−1). Moreover, the higher-SAR sample of Ni/DAB(220) displays no activity, comparable to that of Ni/SiO2. These observations suggest that the removal of Al atoms is detrimental to the catalytic activity of Ni.",
          "It is apparent that the catalytic activity and stability are intricately linked to the SAR of Beta zeolites. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), both excessively low and high SAR values can inhibit the occurrence of dimerization reaction. Notedly, as the SAR value approaches 5.5, the catalyst demonstrates superior performance. The presence of Al species appears to be crucial for Ni-catalyzed propylene dimerization, as evidenced by the inactivity of Ni-CIT-6, an Al-free zincosilicate sample possessing the *BEA topology (Fig. S1). These findings underscore the significance of maintaining an optimal SAR in Beta zeolites to achieve desired catalytic performance. The modification process not only enhances the catalytic activity but also provides an effective catalyst with an extended operational lifetime."

          "The influence of modification treatment on dimer selectivity and product distribution, in relation to propylene conversion, is shown in Fig. 3 (a). It is evident that the selectivities towards C6 olefins on all four desilicated samples are diminished compared to the unmodified Ni/Beta(12) sample. Notedly, the Ni/DSB(5.5) catalyst, exhibiting the highest catalytic activity, demonstrates the lowest C6 selectivity (69.1 %). This reduced selectivity can be attributed to the enhanced catalytic activity of Ni sites within the desilicated sample. As a result, the formed dimer product is susceptible to subsequent reactions with propylene, leading to a decrement in C6 selectivity as propylene conversion increases. Conversely, as propylene conversion decreases due to catalyst deactivation, a gradual increase in C6 selectivity is observed on the alkaline-treated samples. In contrast, the dealuminated samples exhibit a concurrent decline in C6 selectivity, accompanied by rapid catalyst deactivation. This distinct pattern of selectivity change differs from all other Ni-based samples but is similar to the characteristics observed in the Ni-free Beta zeolite in our previous study [17].",
          "A detailed analysis of the C6 distribution on different Ni-based samples is presented in Fig. 3(b-d). On all samples, a total of twelve distinct isomeric structures of dimers are detected, with t4M2P and t2H exhibiting the highest percentages. Notedly, as propylene conversion increases, the distribution of these two dimers also rises. When comparing the reaction results of the alkaline-treated samples with the untreated Ni/Beta(12), it is evident that the relationship between C6 distribution and propylene conversion displays remarkable similarities. This suggests that the reaction occurs primarily on the Ni site, and the state of Ni species within the desilicated samples is likely comparable to that of the untreated sample, where the active centers reside in a tetra-coordinated environment [17]. It is noteworthy that our findings reveal that the distribution of all dimeric products does not go through the origin when extrapolating C6 products to zero conversion. This observation implies that all products are generated during the initial stages of the reaction. According to the Cossee-Arlman mechanism [17,33], dimerization proceeds simultaneously through four distinct reaction pathways (Fig. 4 ). The results indicate that the two products with the highest percentages are primarily formed via the 2,2-coordination insertion and 1,2-coordination insertion pathways. Furthermore, the percentages of these products gradually increase as conversion rises. This analysis provides valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and product distributions in Ni-based zeolite catalysis, facilitating the optimization of catalytic systems for improved performance."

          "The construction of mesoporous structure within Ni-based catalysts is achieved through modification procedures applied to zeolite supports. Consequently, the porosity and textural properties of these catalysts are examined using low-temperature N2 physisorption analysis, as presented in Fig. 5 and Table S1. The adsorption–desorption curves of all samples exhibit type I isotherms (Fig. 5(a)), characteristic of typical microporous materials. Therein, the untreated Ni/Beta(12) displays a weak H4-type hysteresis loop in the medium- to high-pressure range (P/P0 = 0.6 – 0.95), indicative of the presence of intercrystalline mesopores. The textural structure of the catalysts is profoundly influenced by various treatment methods. Following alkaline treatments, the micropore volume gradually decreases as the structure undergoes degradation. Concurrently, there is an increase in mesopore volume and mesopore surface area, resulting in a gradual enhancement of the Vmeso./Vtotal ratio from 81.1 % to 91.0 %. It is suggested that the increase in mesopore volume is attributed to the removal of some framework atoms, leading to pore expansion within the zeolites and triggering the formation of secondary mesoporous structures [22]. This speculation is supported by additional experimental evidence. In the specific case of Ni/DSB(5.5), the adsorption and desorption isotherms display a H3-type hysteresis loop with a broadened pore neck width in the high-pressure region (0.7 – 1.0). This observation suggests the formation of a novel intercrystalline mesoporous structure within the alkaline-treated sample [34]. The removal of Si atoms is associated with the development of mesoporosity, which enhances the exposure of the outer specific surface [30]. This characteristic may be advantageous for improving the reaction performance of the catalyst.",
          "The generation of mesoporous structure upon modification treatment is also corroborated by alterations in the pore size distribution. As illustrated in Fig. 5(b) for Ni/Beta(12), in addition to a distinct concentration of NLDFT pore size distribution within the microporous range of 0 – 1.3 nm, a minor but broad peak is located in the mesoporous interval above 2.8 nm. For the desilicated samples, the peaks in the microporous region maintain in similar positions, yet their intensity is notably diminished. Concurrently, there is a gradual increase in the intensity of peaks within the mesoporous region, thereby affirming the emergence of numerous secondary mesoporous structures. As the desilication process intensifies, the distribution center gradually shifts towards larger pore sizes, while the microporous structure persists. Notably, upon alkaline treatment, the mesoporous network expands and migrates towards a larger zone, with the distribution centers increasing from ∼ 5 nm for Ni/Beta(12) to ∼ 11 nm for Ni/DSB(5.5). This phenomenon indicates that alkaline treatment not only enhances mesoporosity but also induces the formation of larger mesopores, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance potential of these modified catalysts. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence for the successful generation of mesoporous structures through modification treatments and highlight the critical role of desilication and alkaline treatment in tailoring the pore size distribution and enhancing the catalytic properties of Ni-based catalysts.",
          "As discussed above, the pore properties of the support are efficiently modulated through alkaline treatment, giving rise to a hierarchical structure. These newly-generated mesoporous structures are generally recognized as beneficial for enhancing the diffusion rate of reactants and products during the reaction process. This enhancement prevents pore blockage by products, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst in various reactions [18,22,35]. In the present study, the introduction of a hierarchical structure in the supports effectively minimizes the intercrystallite diffusion resistance encountered by oligomerization products and facilitates their desorption, avoiding the coke deposition on Ni sites. The product accumulation blocked in the pores is limited, which is beneficial for catalyst stability enhancement.",
          "To confirm that the carbon deposition on the modified catalyst with hierarchical pore structure is improved, TG-MS analysis is performed on the spent Ni/Beta(12) and Ni/DSB(5.5) catalysts in an air atmosphere (Fig. S2). The results show two distinct weight loss stages at 200 – 350°C and 350 – 600 °C for both catalysts, corresponding to the oxidation of adsorbed olefins and coke deposition, respectively. As expected, for the unmodified catalyst of Ni/Beta(12), the removal of carbon deposits leads to a 4 % mass loss (from ∼ 92 % to ∼ 88 %), whereas the modified catalyst of Ni/DSB(5.5) exhibits only a 2 % reduction (from ∼ 94 % to ∼ 92 %). Meanwhile, the CO2 peak intensity of the modified catalyst is distinctly weaker than the unmodified counterpart. These results indicate that the coke deposition on the modified catalyst is halved compared to the unmodified counterpart. Therefore, it is verified that the formation of hierarchical pore structures and enlarged mesopores accelerate the diffusion rate of products, suppress the accumulation of polymeric byproducts within the pores, and consequently retard catalyst deactivation.",
          "Consequently, the modified catalysts, especially Ni/DSB(5.5), exhibit remarkable stability, with a significantly reduced deactivation rate of 0.0109 h−1, superior to the unmodified catalyst. This compares favorably to the stability of the unmodified catalyst. The present study offers an effective strategy to address the challenges associated with poor stability, a common issue encountered in Ni-based zeolite catalysts for olefin oligomerization. By leveraging alkaline treatment to introduce a hierarchical pore structure, we have developed a more robust and stable catalyst for olefin oligomerization reactions."

          "In addition to textural properties, metallicity plays a pivotal role in determining the catalytic performance, since Ni has been established as the active center for dimerization. Evidently, a high RC value for the support appears to facilitate the dispersion of Ni species on its surface. As demonstrated in Fig. S3, for Ni/Beta(12) and Ni/DSB(5.5) samples, which possess relatively intact zeolite framework structures, no diffraction peaks attributed to Ni species are observed. This suggests that the metal is well dispersed on the support. However, in the case of the Ni/DSB(2.2) sample, which exhibits a destructed framework structure, distinct diffraction peaks emerge at 37.3° and 43.3°, corresponding to the (003) and (202) crystal planes of NiO crystals (ICSD No. 89–3080), respectively. This revelation underscores the importance of maintaining appropriate crystallinity to prevent severe aggregation of metal species. Furthermore, our results indicate that modifications to the support can be detrimental to Ni dispersion. This may be attributed to the leaching of Si and Al hydroxyl groups, which weakens the metal-support interaction and subsequently leads to metal agglomeration. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the effects of support modifications on metal dispersion and catalytic performance.",
          "Here we further analyze the morphology and dispersion of NiO nanoparticles in the Ni-containing catalysts by electron microscopy. Fig. 6 presents the representative HAADF-STEM and HRTEM images. It is revealed that the majority of the NiO particles in all catalysts exhibit a nearly spherical morphology. A consistent lattice distance of approximately 0.209 nm in the HRTEM images for the selected NiO nanoparticles, corresponding to the (202) plane of the cubic NiO phase. Notably, the unmodified Ni/Beta(12) catalyst exhibits the highest degree of Ni dispersion (17.1 %, Table S3) in the HAADF-STEM images, with the smallest average particle size of 2.4 nm. However, modifications to the zeolite support, specifically the destruction of the zeolite framework, introduce varying degrees of NiO particle agglomeration. Firstly, the agglomeration phenomenon is closely linked to the crystallinity of the zeolite support. As observed, the Ni/DSB(5.5) catalyst demonstrates a well-defined crystalline structure (RC = 56 %), with an average nanoparticle size of 3.7 nm and a metal dispersion of 11.1 %. In contrast, the Ni/DSB(2.2) catalyst (RC = 0) exhibits a significant increase in particle size to 30.0 nm, accompanied by a substantial reduction in metal dispersion to 1.4 %. Secondly, the Al species present in the support play a pivotal role in enhancing metal dispersion. For instance, the dealuminated Ni/DAB(220) sample, despite experiencing minimal framework structure loss (RC 76 %), exhibits NiO particles with an average size of 30.2 nm. This underscores the importance of Al species in promoting Ni dispersion. Moreover, modifications to the support weaken the interaction between Ni species and the hydroxyl groups, particularly the Al-hydroxyl groups. This weakening of the metal-support interaction leads to the agglomeration of Ni species. Consequently, the Al-free Ni/CIT-6 sample exhibits numerous large NiO particles with sizes exceeding 50 nm (Fig. S4). In summary, both the preservation of the zeolite framework structure and the presence of Al species are crucial for achieving high metal dispersion in Ni-based catalysts. These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design and optimization of zeolite-supported Ni catalysts for various catalytic applications.",
          "In our previous study [17], it was unambiguously demonstrated that the catalytic activity for propylene dimerization primarily stemmed from isolated Ni sites, rather than the Beta zeolite support. Generally, a high degree of Ni dispersion is crucial for enhancing metal utilization and providing a greater number of active centers, thereby positively impacting the catalytic activity of propylene dimerization. Consequently, catalysts such as Ni/DSB(2.2), Ni/DAB(220), and Ni/CIT-6, which process large NiO particles, exhibit negligible activity in this study. However, when Ni/DSB(5.5) and Ni/Beta(12) are employed for propylene dimerization, an intriguing trend was observed. Despite having larger metal nanoparticle sizes, the Ni/DSB(5.5) catalyst exhibited a higher reaction rate. This observation suggests that the enhancement in catalytic dimerization activity may be attributed to a more distinct and favorable chemical state of Ni species. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon will be elucidated in detail in the subsequent section."

          "As previously reported [9], the chemical state of Ni species within catalysts exerts a profound influence on the olefin oligomerization reaction. Notably, the alterations in the chemical environment of Ni species, arising from the modification treatments, play a pivotal role in determining the course of the reaction. The H2-TPR results of Ni supported on the modified Beta zeolite are presented in Fig. 7 (a). The observed reduction peaks correspond to the consumption of hydrogen during the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0. Given the variable chemical environments of Ni2+ cations, significant differences in reduction difficulty are observed, resulting in distinct reduction temperatures. Ni/DAB(107) and Ni/DAB(220) exhibit multiple reduction peaks in the temperature range of 250 – 500 °C. This indicates that the NiO nanoparticles are distributed unevenly and a portion of particles are agglomerated severely for the dealuminated samples [36], which is consistent with the complex size distribution in our TEM results. Contrastingly, the desilicated samples exhibit a more focused and a higher reduction temperature range with a symmetrical peak pattern, implying that the Ni species in a more uniform state are located primarily within the zeolites, making them more resistant to reduction by hydrogen [37,38]. As the desilication treatment becomes more intense, with a decreasing Si/Al ratio and a gradually deteriorating support framework, the reduction temperature of Ni2+ cations gradually increases, ranging from 474 °C for Ni/Beta(12) to 557 °C for Ni/DSB(2.2). This suggests that the removal of silicon atoms enhances the interaction between Ni species and the modified supports. The Ni species are regulated to alter the coordination state with the framework oxygen atoms of the support, leading to an increased reduction difficulty.",
          "The coordination environment of Ni2+ cations, though intricate, holds paramount significance in determining the catalytic performance. UV–Vis-NIR spectroscopy is frequently employed to investigate the coordination state of Ni species dispersed on catalysts, because only 3F ground state and 3P excited state of Ni2+ cations are present since the absence of the Jahn-Teller effect, corresponding to the three spin-allowed d-d charge transfer appearing in the near-infrared and visible regions [39]. Fig. 7(b) reveals a noticeable decrement in the absorption band intensity at 1410 nm, which corresponds to hydroxyl groups [37]. This decrease is associated with the introduction of Ni species, indicating that Ni species displace some surface hydroxyl groups. For Ni/DSB(2.2) and Ni/DAB(220) samples, the Ni species primarily reside in a hexa-coordinated state, exhibiting similar spectra with absorption bands at 380 nm, 420 nm, 720 nm, and 1130 (1180) nm. These spectra closely resemble those of bulk NiO and are attributed to d-d charge transitions of hexa-coordinated Ni species in an octahedral environment [37,40–42].",
          "Moreover, the bands observed at 515 nm and 670 nm are attributed to the mononuclear Ni(II) octahedral structure [29,43,44], corresponding to a portion of highly dispersed Ni2+ cations hexa-coordinated with zeolite framework oxygen atoms. Notably, a minor fraction of Ni2+ cations exists in a tetra-coordinated environment, evident from a weak absorption band detected at 460 nm [29,37]. Conversely, in Ni/Beta(12) and Ni/DSB(5.5), tetra-coordinated Ni2+ cations are the predominant species, exhibiting a more pronounced absorption intensity at 430 nm, 460 nm, and 760 nm, ascribed to Ni2+ cations situated at tetrahedral centers [29,42]. These coordinatively unsaturated Ni sites exhibit Lewis acid characteristics, which is the main form in these two catalysts. Therein, Ni/DSB(5.5) owns the highest acid amount (Table S4). Additionally, a small proportion of hexa-coordinated Ni species coexist within these samples, manifesting as additional absorption bands at 670 nm and 1180 nm. Taken together with previous observations [17,45] and the higher catalytic activities exhibited by Ni/Beta(12) and Ni/DSB(5.5), it is postulated that tetra-coordinated Ni cations serve as the active centers for the dimerization reaction. XPS analysis is conducted to elucidate the electronic structure of the catalysts through the examination of binding energies associated with O 1 s, Si 2p, and Ni 2p species within the samples. Fig. 8 (a) displays the Si 2p spectra of the various samples, revealing a binding energy range for Si species spanning from 102.8 eV to 103.9 eV. This upward shift in binding energy is observed to correlate with an escalating Si/Al ratio, indicating a progressive augmentation in the covalent nature of the Si-O bond [46]. Fig. 8(b) presents the O 1 s binding energies among all Ni-based samples, which are situated within the range of 531.8 eV to 533.1 eV. Notably, these values surpass the binding energy of NiO (530.0 eV), indicating a diminished ionic character of oxygen atoms within the Ni-O bonds compared to those present in bulk NiO. This observation serves as evidence for the formation of mononuclear Si(Al)-O-Ni species [29], where the electronic interaction with the oxygen atom reduces its ionic character. Due to the higher electronegativity of Si atoms compared to Al atoms, the ionic character of oxygen atoms is reduced, resulting in a gradual increase in the binding energy of O 1 s with an increasing Si/Al ratio within the samples.",
          "To further assess the impact of Al species on the binding energy of Ni2+ cations, a supplementary experiment is carried out, synthesizing the Al-doped sample Ni/Al-DAB(220) by incorporating Al3+ cations into the Ni/DAB(220) sample. A comparative analysis of the XPS results, presented in Fig. S5(a), reveals an intriguing finding. Specifically, the introduction of Al3+ cations leads to a noteworthy increase in the Ni 2p3/2 binding energy, from 856.8 eV for Ni/DAB(220) to 857.4 eV for Ni/Al-DAB(220). This substantial enhancement verifies that the addition of more electronegative Al3+ cations effectively withdraw electrons from Ni2+ cations, resulting in a chemical shift of the Ni species towards a higher binding energy. This observation aligns with the results observed for Ni/DSB(5.5), indicating a consistent trend in the modulation of Ni2+ cation binding energy by Al species.",
          "Importantly, upon doping Al into the inactive Ni/DAB(220) sample, the resulting Ni/Al-DAB(220) sample exhibits a remarkable enhancement in catalytic activity, with an increase in initial conversion by 40 % as shown in Fig. S5(b). Al species have been reported as a crucial component in oligomerization catalysts. Especially for homogeneous system, it has been confirmed that the addition of alkylaluminum or alternatives (such as methylaluminoxane, MAO) as the cocatalysts could activate and stabilize Ni site, and promotes some key processes of oligomerization [33]. Nonetheless, it has been reported that Al species alone possess limited reactivity, with Ni species serving as the primary active sites [17]. Therefore, the crucial role of Al species in enhancing the catalytic performance of Ni centers becomes evident. The observed enhancement in catalytic activity resulting from Al doping is closely associated with the increased electronic-deficiency state of Ni2+ cations. This finding underscores the significance of Al species in modulating the electronic properties and, consequently, the catalytic activity of Ni-based zeolite materials.",
          "According to the Cossee-Arlman mechanism, the dimerization reaction of propylene initiates with π-adsorption between the electron-rich carbon–carbon double bond and the electron-deficient Ni2+ cations, followed by a coordination-insertion process [17]. An enhancement in the electron-deficient degree of Ni2+ cations notably improve their ability to activate propylene molecules, subsequently enhancing the catalytic conversion of propylene. Consequently, the electron-withdrawing effect exerted by EFAl species on Ni2+ cations facilitate their catalytic efficiency in propylene dimerization. Accordingly, the introduction of Al doping also restores the reactivity of the inactive Ni/DAB(220). Similarly, our findings also rationalize the high activity observed in Ni/Beta(12) and Ni/DSB(5.5) samples, which can be attributed to an increase in the electron-deficiency degree of Ni2+ cations. Conversely, in Ni/DSB(2.2) and Ni/DAB(220) samples lacking EFAl species, resulting in the lower binding energy of Ni2+ cations with a reduced electron-deficiency degree, lead to weaker propylene activation and, ultimately, lower catalytic activity for propylene dimerization."

          "In this work, the coordination environment of Ni species as well as the metal-support interaction in Ni/Beta catalysts are modified by regulating the support structure, significantly enhancing their catalytic activity and stability in the dimerization of propylene. The alkaline-treatment successfully constructs a hierarchical structure, especially, increasing the porous distribution centers from 5 nm in the Ni/Beta(12) to ca. 11 nm in the Ni/DSB(5.5). The generation of secondary mesoporosity effectively promotes the diffusion of products and accordingly lowers the deactivation rate from 0.0663 h−1 to 0.0109 h−1. Furthermore, the formation of EFAl species following alkaline treatment deepens the electron-deficient state of Ni cations, providing an optimal chemical state for propylene molecule activation. The optimal sample, Ni/DSB(5.5), exhibits the deepest electron-deficient degree and demonstrates outstanding catalytic activity, achieving a reaction rate of 182.1 molC3=/(molNi·h), significantly higher than the unmodified sample, which yields a rate of 151.3 molC3=/(molNi·h). These findings provide valuable insights into catalyst design and pave the way for the development of more robust and efficient catalysts for olefin oligomerization."

    "abstract": "An important stage of cascade transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to value-added chemicals is the conversion of levulinic acid and its esters in γ-valerolactone, which has a potential application as a bio-based solvent, an intermediate in the production of polymers, food additives and bio-fuels. Herein, hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites have demonstrated high catalytic performance and reusability in this reaction under mild conditions (115 °C, atmospheric pressure). The novel approach for the preparation of these zeolites with various Zr content has been proposed. This two-step post-synthetic method includes dealumination of hierarchical Al-BEA obtained in the highly concentrated reaction mixture followed by zirconium incorporation via wet impregnation. The hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolite with the highest degree of zirconium incorporation, i.e. 42 %, calculated as the ratio of Lewis acid site concentration and Zr content, is obtained using wet impregnation in dry ethanol and ZrCl4 as a zirconium source. This catalyst provides a higher initial rate of γ-valerolactone formation, which is 1.0 mmolGVL/gcath, as compared to commercially-based Zr-BEA, for which the rate is 0.2 mmolGVL/gcath. The higher reaction rate over hierarchical zeolite is associated with the improved accessibility of its strong Lewis acid sites, which are the most active in Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction. An even higher initial rate is achieved over hierarchical Zr-BEA in the conversion of butyl levulinate since this ester does not block the basic framework oxygen of active Zr–O sites, as in the case of levulinic acid. The plausible mechanism for the transformation of levulinic acid over Lewis and Brønsted acid sites has been proposed.",

          "The depletion of non-renewable carbon resources, including petroleum and natural gas, intensifies investigations designed to valorise of lignocellulosic biomass into bio-fuels and value-added chemicals [1–4]. Multi-stage catalytic transformation of the main components of biomass, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, allows obtaining γ-valerolactone (GVL) (Scheme 1 ) [5–8]. GVL has important potential application as a bio-based solvent in organic reactions [9,10], an intermediate in the production of polymers and various chemicals [11,12], food additives [5,12], bio-fuels [13,14] and fuel additives [15,16]. The final and important stage of this transformation is catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) and its esters to GVL [17]. For this reaction, homogeneous metal complexes [18] and heterogeneous metal supported catalysts [19,20] with molecular hydrogen [21] and formic acid [22] as H-donors have been proposed. The implementation of these approaches is accompanied by difficulties associated with the use of high-pressure molecular hydrogen, the equipment corrosion caused by formic acid, separation and regeneration of homogeneous catalysts or reduction operations in the synthesis of supported catalysts and metal leaching [17]. Transfer hydrogenation via Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction in the presence of heterogeneous catalyst and secondary alcohol as H-donor is alternative and effective approach for production of GVL without aforementioned drawbacks [23].",
          "Zr and Sn-containing zeolites [24,25] are the most active and selective catalysts for the MPV reduction of LA and its esters to GVL and the yield of this lactone above 90 % can be obtained at 120 °C over Zr-BEA [26]. The incorporation of these heteroatoms into the zeolite framework generates Lewis acid sites with unoccupied orbital, which participates in the adsorption and activation of reactants [27]. The increased activity of Zr- and Sn-zeolites is explained by the enhanced surface area and water tolerance of their Lewis acid sites, which remain active even in the presence of water formed during LA conversion. The higher activity of Zr-BEA as compared to Sn-BEA in MPV reduction is associated with the ability of Zr sites to coordinate and more strongly polarise the carbonyl group of aldehyde, facilitating the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from the alcohol to the carbonyl group [28]. Metal oxides including ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, CeZrOx, ZrO2 doped with boron [29,30], metal-organic frameworks [31–35], hybrid organic-inorganic materials [36–39], Hf-based carbonaceous material [40], BEA-Zr-BDC-MOF composite catalyst [41] and ZrO2/SBA-15 [42] have also been used as catalysts for the transformation of LA or alkyl levulinates to GVL. However, the activity of these catalysts is lower than for Zr- or Sn-zeolites and GVL yield above 90 % can be achieved only at reaction temperatures higher than 150 °C. Among these catalysts, Zr-BEA zeolite has been found to be the most perspective for the MPV reduction of LA to GVL due to its open three-dimensional 12-MR channel system, which improves the accessibility of reactants to the Lewis acid sites.",
          "Zr-BEA zeolite can be obtained by direct hydrothermal synthesis [43–45] or via a post-synthetic treatment [46–49]. Post-synthetic modification is a two-step process involving dealumination of the parent Al-BEA by acid treatment followed by zirconium incorporation into vacant sites (silanol nests) of zeolite framework via liquid grafting (reflux in a solvent, washing and calcination) [48,50], impregnation (evaporation of the solvent and calcination) [47,51] or solid-state metallation [46,52]. The use of post-synthesis approach allows to overcome the disadvantages of the direct hydrothermal synthesis, such as long crystallization time, limited content of framework zirconium and the use of toxic hydrogen fluoride [45]. Another advantage of this indirect approach is the possibility of obtaining hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites with additional mesoporosity, since hierarchical Al-BEA as a parent material can easily be synthesized by various procedures [53–56].",
          "The acid sites of hierarchical zeolites located in mesopores or on the external surface allow to convert bulky molecules, for which the acid sites in the zeolite micropores are inaccessible [57–60]. The presence of well-developed mesoporosity in hierarchical zeolites contributes to improved accessibility of the active sites for reacting molecules and accelerates the diffusion of reagents and reaction products, providing increased catalytic activity in the conversion of biomass and platform molecules [52,61]. Hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites have demonstrated high catalytic performance in a number of cascade processes or reactions involving bulky molecules, such as ethanol-acetaldehyde conversion into 1,3-butadiene [62], the conversion of carbohydrates to lactic acid [63], the ring-opening aminolysis of epoxides [46]. Hierarchical Zr-Al-BEA zeolites have been also used as catalysts in cascade transformation of hemicellulose, C5 carbohydrates and furfural to GVL [64], glucose conversion to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, glycerol and trioses conversion to methyl and ethyl lactates [52,65]. Therefore, it can be envisaged that hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolite is a promising catalyst for the transformation of LA and its esters to GVL involving the formation of bulky intermediate products. This catalyst can help to overcome the transport limitation and increase the reaction rate.",
          "For obtaining the hierarchical Zr-BEA and Zr-Al-BEA zeolites, several methods have been proposed, such as direct synthesis using Gemini-type surfactants as structure-directing agents [66], partial dealumination-desilication-deep dealumination of the parent Al-BEA for introducing mesoporosity with subsequent Zr incorporation by solid-state metallation with zirconocene dichloride [46,52] and zirconium(IV) acetylacetonate [64]. Other methods require cetyltrimethylammonim bromide [62] and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride [63] as mesoporogens and impregnation of dealuminated hierarchical BEA with aqueous solution of zirconium (IV) nitrate or oxychloride. Hierarchical Zr-Al-BEA zeolite has been also obtained by synthesis of Al-BEA using sacrificial resin beads as hard template, partial dealumination and Zr grafting in 1-propanol [65]. Generally, these methods have some drawbacks, such as the necessity of using complex and expensive additional templates and zirconium sources or time-consuming dealumination-desilication operations to generate mesoporosity. Thus, the development of a new, more convenient and efficient method for obtaining hierarchical Zr-BEA is still required.",
          "Herein we report on the novel approach for obtaining hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites and their application in the conversion of LA and butyl levulinate (BL) into GVL. This approach is based on dealumination of hierarchical Al-BEA obtained in a highly concentrated reaction mixture at H2O/Si = 5.5 M ratio followed by zirconium incorporation by wet impregnation in dry ethanol. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolite with Si/Zr ratio of 20 are more active catalysts in the aforementioned reactions than commercially-based Zr-BEA due to the higher concentration of strong Lewis acid sites and moderate concentration of Brønsted acid sites. To the best of our knowledge, the method for hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolite preparation without using additional structure-directing agent, expensive zirconium sources and dealumination-desilication operations has been proposed herein for the first time. In addition, hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites have been used as catalysts of levulinic acid and butyl levulinate conversion to GVL for the first time."

This approach has been introduced in Refs. [75–77] and based on the formation of a large number of zeolite nuclei during the hydrothermal treatment of the precursor with a low water content. The subsequent crystallization leads to the transformation of amorphous gels into tightly aggregated zeolite nanocrystals forming mesoporous honeycomb-like structure. The tight aggregation of zeolite nanocrystals prevents their growth into larger crystals.",

Commercial zeolite also contains nanocrystals with a similar size (ca. 17 nm), but they are loosely aggregated in the smaller secondary particles of about 2–3 μm in size.",
          "Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the hierarchical h-BEA and commercial c-BEA zeolites (Fig. 1) are referred to type IV according to the IUPAC classification [79], which is typical for micro-mesopores materials. The hysteresis loop of type H1 at p/p0 0.50–0.98 is associated with nitrogen condensation in the intercrystalline mesopores with the size of 9–13 nm (Fig. 1). The mesopore size distribution is more distinct and uniform for the hierarchical zeolite than for commercial Al-BEA. This advantage can be due to the formation of an ordered structure of zeolite nanocrystals in the hierarchical zeolite as a result of the assembly and intergrowth of these primary particles in the highly concentrated mixtures [80]. The more ordered intergrowth of zeolite nanocrystals in h-BEA sample leads to an increase in the mesopore volume, total and external surface area (Table 2 ) as compared to the commercial zeolite. The chemical composition of h-BEA (Si/Al = 15) is similar to that of c-BEA (Si/Al = 14)."

          "To optimize the zirconium incorporation method, commercial c-BEA sample has been used as the starting material. Two-step post-synthetic methods involving dealumination with further impregnation in dry ethanol or 2-propanol and solid-state incorporation have been chosen for obtaining Zr-BEA samples. XRD pattern of the dealuminated deal-c-BEA sample corresponds to the diffractogram of the starting zeolite c-BEA (Fig. S1), indicating preservation of the zeolite structure after dealumination. The only difference for the deal-c-BEA sample is a slight shift in the peak position from 22.4 to 22.8° 2θ for diffraction peak (302), which is associated with the decrease in the unit cell parameters. Following incorporation of zirconium, the position of the peak shifts back to 22.4° 2θ. XRD patterns of the cB-Et sample (Fig. 2 a) reveal the presence of the low intensity ZrO2 characteristic peaks in addition to the peaks of Zr-BEA. The more intense peaks of the tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 phases are found for the cB-S sample obtained by solid-state incorporation method. In these cases, ZrO2 phase is formed after calcination of the samples containing the unreacted zirconium salts and Zr4+ hydroxo species resulting from hydrolysis of the zirconium sources.",
          "Morphology of the Zr-BEA samples (SEM images, Figs. S2 and S3) is similar to the parent commercial c-BEA zeolite (Fig. 1). The cB-Et sample consists of nanocrystals with a size of ca. 22 nm (Fig. S2d), which are aggregated into secondary larger particles about 6 μm in size. EDX maps of the c-BEA based samples obtained by wet impregnation (Fig. S3) reveal a homogeneous distribution of Zr in the crystals without formation of the large ZrO2 particles. In contrast, for the cB-S sample obtained by solid-state incorporation, the region with high ZrO2 content is visible in EDX maps (Fig. S3), which is consistent with the XRD data.",
          "The coordination state of zirconium in the obtained samples has been investigated by UV–vis spectroscopy. UV–vis spectrum of commercial ZrO2 (Fig. 2b) shows the bands at 205 and 230 nm due to the charge transfer from O2− to Zr4+ ion and the Zr–O–Zr bonds [63,81], respectively. The presence of the first peak and shoulder of the second peak in the spectra of the commercially-based samples obtained by wet impregnation (Fig. 2b) indicates that the Zr atoms are located both in tetrahedral framework position and octahedral extra-framework coordination. In the spectra of the samples obtained by solid-state incorporation, the distinct band at 230 nm is observed pointing out that more extra-framework Zr species are formed in these samples, which is also confirmed by XRD and SEM-EDX data.",
          "The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and mesopore size distribution curves for dealuminated zeolite deal-c-BEA and all Zr-BEA samples (Fig. S4) correspond to the parent c-BEA. As a result of Al removing from BEA structure, additional mesopores are formed and the mesopore volume increases from 0.62 to 0.82 cm3/g (Table 2, samples c-BEA and deal-c-BEA), while the micropore volume decreases from 0.18 to 0.16 cm3/g. After impregnation of deal-c-BEA with zirconium, the characteristics of the porous structure of Zr-BEA remain almost unchanged (Table 2).",
          "Zr-zeolites have the same zirconium content (Si/Zr = 19, Table 1), except for cB-S with a lower Zr content (Si/Zr = 30). The reduced amount of Zr in this sample detected by EDX analysis further confirms the non-uniform distribution of Zr. The residual aluminium content in the dealuminated sample deal-c-BEA is low (Si/Al = 1110) and does not have a significant effect on the acidic properties of the obtained Zr-BEA samples.",
          "To characterize the acidity of c-BEA-based Zr-BEA zeolites, FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py) has been used. In the spectra of the samples obtained (Fig. 2c and S5), the absorption bands at 1447 and 1608 cm−1 correspond to ring vibrations of pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, which are coordinatively unsaturated Zr atoms. Bands at 1545 and 1638 cm−1 are assigned to ring vibrations of protonated pyridine [51,52]. The Brønsted acid site can be unreacted silanol group in close proximity to the coordinatively unsaturated Zr atoms, because the interaction of the lone electron pair of silanol oxygen with Zr leads to polarization of O–H bond [47,82,83]. The concentration and strength of these Brønsted acid sites in the samples Zr-BEA are relatively low (Table 3 and S1). The concentrations of Lewis (157–161 μmol/g) and Brønsted acid sites (10–17 μmol/g) in the samples obtained by wet impregnation in ethanol (cB-Et) and 2-propanol (cB-Pr) are comparable. For these samples, the low degree of zirconium incorporation (20 %, Table 3) calculated as the ratio of Lewis acid sites concentration and Zr content confirms that substantial amount of zirconium atoms are in octahedral coordination in the form of ZrO2 species with low acidity and limited accessibility for the base molecules [84–86]. The low degree of zirconium incorporation for the Zr-BEA samples obtained via post-synthetic method is in agreement with the previous results [51].",
          "Acidic properties of the Zr-BEA samples have also been investigated by NH3-TPD (Fig. 2d and Table 3 and S2). The first peak in NH3-TPD profiles of the samples corresponds not only to acid sites but also to weak ammonia adsorption on silanol groups, defects etc. The second peak is attributed to adsorption of NH3 on both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, and their concentrations almost coincide with the total acid site concentration observed by Py adsorption method (Tables S1 and S2). For the samples cB-Et and cB-Pr, the concentration of medium-strong (T max 265–270 °C) acid sites from NH3-TPD is similar (161–178 μmol/g). The low concentration of acid sites in the cB-S sample (19 μmol/g) is explained by the poor Zr incorporation into the framework of this sample also confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2b).",
          "The c-BEA-based Zr-BEA zeolites have been tested as catalysts for the transformation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) at 115 °C in a batch reactor (Table 4 ). After 24 h of the reaction, the highest yield of GVL, 56 %, is achieved over cB-Et sample obtained via wet impregnation in dry ethanol. The solid-state incorporation method leads to the formation of the large ZrO2 particles that are practically inactive in the transformation of LA to GVL. Also, the low solubility of zirconium (IV) chloride in 2-propanol [87] prevents the incorporation of zirconium in the zeolite framework leading to low catalytic activity of cB-Pr in the transformation of LA with only 38 % GVL yield after 24 h.",
          "To further optimization of zirconium incorporation method, the conditions for obtaining the most active c-BEA-based Zr-BEA sample, namely wet impregnation in dry ethanol, have been applied to the preparation of the hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites based on h-BEA material. The large surface area and uniform distribution of mesopores in hierarchical zeolites can contribute to an increase in the dispersion of zirconium atoms in the final materials and improving their catalytic properties."

EDX maps (Fig. S3) show that Zr atoms are homogeneously distributed in the crystals of the hierarchical Zr-BEA samples without the presence of the large ZrO2 particles.",

The hierarchical Zr-BEA samples possess higher total (610–675 m2/g, Table 2) and external surface area (270–300 m2/g) as compared to the c-BEA-based zeolites with S BET 550–565 m2/g and S ext 200–210 m2/g. Among the hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites, the sample hB-Et(40) with the lowest ZrO2 content has the highest mesopore volume and the largest total and external surface area. This could be due to the lower extent of pore blocking, since according to UV–vis spectroscopy, this sample has the smallest shoulder at 230 nm. Hence, partial filling of intercrystalline mesopores of the samples with ZrO2 particles can lead to decreasing mesopore volume.",
          "The zirconium content in the hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites is close to the nominal value (Table 1). For hierarchical dealuminated BEA zeolite, the aluminium content is low (Si/Al = 5124).",
          "According to FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, the concentrations of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites are higher for hierarchical hB-Et(20) as compared to the c-BEA-based sample with the same Zr content (Table 3 and S1, Figs. 2 and 3). The increased concentration of the acid sites for the hierarchical zeolite can be associated with its larger external surface area as well as a higher degree of zirconium incorporation (42 %, Table 3) as a result of improved diffusion of the zirconium species to the silanol nest through uniform intercrystalline mesopores. In the FTIR spectrum of dealuminated sample deal-h-BEA (Fig. 3c), only two absorption bands at 1445 and 1598 cm−1 are observed, which are referred to the ring vibrations of pyridine weakly adsorbed on silanol groups. The absence of the other bands in this region confirms the successful dealumination of the hierarchical zeolite h-BEA. Pyridine is almost completely desorbed from these silanols at 250 °C (Fig. S5). For hB-Et(20) and hB-Et(40) samples, the Lewis acid sites concentration increases with the zirconium content (Table 3). Further increase in zirconium content up to 9.8 wt% leads to a slight decrease in the concentration of acid sites from 330 to 317 μmol/g. This effect can be associated with a high content of ZrO2 according to XRD data (Fig. 3) and, hence, the lower dispersion of Zr atoms for hB-Et(13). In general, for the hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites, the trends of changes in total acid sites concentration determined by NH3-TPD method are consistent with the changes in total acid sites content evaluated by the pyridine adsorption method (Table 3, Fig. 3d).",
          "FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CD3CN has been also used to determine the concentration of Lewis acid sites. FTIR spectrum collected after saturation of hB-Et(20) with CD3CN (Fig. S6) shows absorption bands at 2303 cm−1 and 2275 cm−1, corresponding to CD3CN adsorbed on Lewis acid sites and silanol groups, respectively [24]. The concentration of Lewis acid sites for hB-Et(20) is 277 μmol/g, which is close to the value determined from FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Table 3).",
          "Adsorption of CO over zeolites monitored by FTIR spectroscopy allows to differentiate the acid sites by strength [48,83]. At low pressure of the probe, CO molecules interact with the strongest Zr Lewis acid sites of the hB-Et(20) and cB-Et samples, resulting in the appearance of the absorption band at 2192 cm−1 (Fig. S7). With increasing pressure of the probe, CO adsorbs over Zr Lewis acid sites with a lower strength and absorption bands at 2176–2185 cm−1 appear in the spectra. At low pressure of the probe, FTIR spectra of the samples also contain the absorption band at 2164 cm−1, corresponding to CO H-bonded with Brønsted Zr–OH groups and silanol groups in close proximity with Lewis acid sites [83]. At a higher pressure of the probe, the absorption bands at 2156 and 2134–2140 cm−1 are observed, which can be attributed to CO interacting with silanol groups and physisorbed CO, respectively. Using the Gaussian peak shapes, the deconvolution of the spectra of samples saturated with CO (Figs. S7b and d, Table S3) reveal that hierarchical hB-Et(20) has a higher amount of Lewis acid sites, including the strongest ones, as compared to cB-Et(20).",
          "The textural properties of hB-Et(20) sample have been compared with the results for the previously reported Zr-containing BEA zeolites (Table S4). The sample obtained has the largest total and external surface area (610 and 270 m2/g, respectively, entry 25, Table S4) than most of the reported hierarchical, commercially-based and conventional Zr-containing BEA zeolites. In addition, hB-Et(20) possesses double the mesopore volume of hierarchical Zr-BEA [46] and Zr-Al-BEA [52] obtained by solid-state incorporation (0.77 cm3/g vs. 0.31–0.34 cm3/g) with comparable total and external surface area. The method for producing HierZr-BEA (entry 1) requires additional time-consuming dealumination-desilication operations to generate mesoporosity and a more expensive zirconium source (Cp2ZrCl2 vs. ZrCl4). Despite of the enhanced total and external surface area of HierZr-Al-BEA [64] (entry 19) and ComZr-Al-BEA [88,89] (entry 22), they also have small mesopore volume (<0.31 cm3/g), which can be due to the formation of large ZrO2 particles, partially blocking the mesopores during wet impregnation in water."

All hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites almost completely convert LA into the products within 24 h of reaction (Fig. 4 a, Table 5 ). The lower conversion of LA (62 % after 24 h) over cB-Et sample can be explained by the low concentration of its acid sites (174 μmol/g, Table 3) and the reduced diffusion rate of the reagents and reaction products inside the less uniform mesopores of this sample (Fig. S4) as compared to hierarchical zeolites with uniform mesopores. When the reaction time is less than 24 h, the conversion of LA increases with decreasing Si/Zr ratio from 40 to 20 due to an increase in the total acid sites concentration based on pyridine adsorption (Table 3).",
          "Samples hB-Et(40) and cB-Et with a lower amount of Brønsted acid sites, as compared to hB-Et(20) and hB-Et(13), demonstrate the highest selectivity towards GVL, which reaches 99 and 90 % at 60 % conversion of LA, respectively (Fig. 4b, Table 5). Enhanced LA esterification to sec-pentyl LEV and decrease in selectivity to GVL in the presence of Zr-Al-BEA containing Brønsted acid sites have been reported previously [26]. The result of blank experiment reveals that only 5 % LA converts to reaction products without the formation of GVL (Table 5), since Lewis acidity is required for the MPV reduction of LA.",
          "The highest initial rate of GVL formation, such as 1.0–1.1 mmolGVL/gcath, is achieved when using hierarchical hB-Et(20) and hB-Et(13) samples (Table 5) with an increased concentration of Lewis acid sites. In turn, hierarchical zeolite hB-Et(40) shows a high selectivity to GVL and therefore the highest TOFGVL (Table 5). This sample has relatively low Lewis acid site concentration (155 μmol/g), but its external surface area is the largest (300 m2/g) among the Zr-containing samples. Hence, the highly accessible isolated zirconium Lewis acid sites are preferable for GVL formation. The yield of GVL after 24 h increases with the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites and their accessibility to reagents reaching 98–99 % for hB-Et(20) and hB-Et(40) samples (Fig. 4c, Table 5).",
          "The by-products of the transformation of LA are sec-pentyl levulinate (sec-pentyl LEV), sec-pentyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (sec-pentyl HP) and aldol condensation products of LA with 2-pentanol (δ-sec-pentylidenelevulinic acid and β-sec-pentylidenelevulinic acid). The experimental MS spectra of these compounds are given in Figs. S8–S11. Based on the changes in product selectivity with increasing LA conversion (Fig. S12) and previously reported results [26,38,90], three reaction pathways for the transformation of LA to GVL have been proposed (Scheme 2 ). The first pathway involves MPV reduction of LA to 4-hydroxypentanoic acid over Lewis acid sites with its subsequent rapid lactonization over both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites (Scheme S1). According to the MPV reaction mechanism, 2-pentanol and LA are coordinated to the same Zr Lewis acid site forming six-membered complex (Scheme S1), in which polarization induces a hydride shift from both C1 atoms and OH-group of the alcohol to the carbonyl group of LA [90]. Framework oxygen atom with basic properties connected to Zr atom also participates in the formation of the active complex by interacting with the hydrogen of the OH-group of 2-pentanol [32]. Following the second pathway, sec-pentyl LEV is formed as a result of LA esterification with 2-pentanol via SN2 mechanism that involves protonation of LA or its coordination with Lewis acid sites followed by the nucleophilic attack of the electrophilic α-carbon of LA by the OH group of 2-pentanol. MPV reduction of sec-pentyl LEV gives sec-pentyl HP lactonized to GVL. Based on the third pathway, the formation of GVL proceeds through the aldol condensation of LA and 2-pentanol over both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (Scheme S1and Scheme S2, respectively), MPV reduction of the aldol condensation products and retro-aldol reaction. In addition, the gradual self-etherification of 2-pentanol into the corresponding ether is observed over obtained zeolites, but the yield of this ether is less than 1 %. For most Zr-BEA zeolites, the selectivity towards sec-pentyl LEV and sec-pentyl HP passes through a maximum with increasing LA conversion, while the selectivity towards aldol condensation products decreases (Fig. S12).",
          "An in situ catalytic experiment monitored by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S13) has been used to investigate the reaction pathways for the transformation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone. In the FTIR spectra of levulinic acid solution in 2-pentanol deposited on hB-Et(20) sample, the absorption bands at 1402, 1653 and 1757 cm−1 are observed, corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the O–C=O bonds of LA and stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group of the acid, respectively [91]. At the first stage of the reaction, the carbonyl group of LA is reduced to hydroxyl group and the band at 1757 cm−1 disappears after heating of hB-Et(20) sample at 80 °C for 10 min. Heating of the sample at 115 °C for 20 min leads to the appearance of a new band at 1762 cm−1, which is referred to stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group of γ-valerolactone, its intensity increases as the reaction proceeds. The intensity of absorption bands at 1402 and 1653 cm−1 gradually decreases and these bands disappear after 45 min of the reaction at 115 °C. These in situ catalytic results confirm the proposed reactions pathways (1) and (2) in Scheme 2. At the beginning of the reaction, the carbonyl group of LA and its esters is reduced to hydroxyl group, which then interacts with the carboxyl group of LA with the formation of γ-valerolactone.",
          "The influence of the type and concentration of Zr-BEA acid sites on their catalytic activity in the transformation of LA into GVL and the corresponding correlations are shown in Fig. 5 . The initial rate of GVL formation increases with the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites determined by pyridine adsorption and reaches plateau at the concentration of this acid sites of ca. 30 μmol/g (Fig. 5a). A higher amount of strong Lewis acid sites determined by CO adsorption in hierarchical hB-Et(20) sample, as compared to cB-Et (Table S3), also proves this correlation. The plateau can be associated with a high ZrO2 content leading to limitation in the diffusion of reagents and intermediates in the samples with higher zirconium content. The strong Lewis acid sites can be designated as “open”, in which Zr atom forms three bonds with framework oxygen atoms and a one bond with a hydroxyl group [28,83]. The presence of this hydroxyl group in Zr active sites increases polarization and length of C–O bond of adsorbed LA, accelerating its hydrogenation [45]. In turn, Brønsted acid sites, which can be unreacted silanol groups in close proximity to Lewis acid sites, promote esterification of LA decreasing selectivity towards GVL (Fig. 5b), hence, a longer reaction time is required to increase in GVL yield (Fig. 4).",
          "Catalytic performance of the hierarchical hB-Et(20) sample in the transformation of LA to GVL under mild conditions ( ≤ 120 °C) have been compared with reported catalysts (Table S5). hB-Et(20) with large external surface area and optimal acid sites strength allows obtaining a higher GVL yield compared to Sn-BEA [92] (entry 3), H-Y [90] (entry 5) and glucose phosphate carbamide zirconium [38] (entry 6). Zr-BEA zeolites obtained by direct hydrothermal synthesis (entries 1–2) [26] demonstrate similar or even higher catalytic activity than hB-Et(20), but the process is carried out at a higher temperature (118 °C) and catalyst/substrate mass ratio (1.72 w/w) than in our case (115 °C, 1.11 w/w, respectively)."

          "Butyl levulinate (BL) has also been used as a substrate for the production of GVL (Table 6 , Fig. S14). A higher initial rate of GVL formation is achieved over hB-Et(20) with an increased Lewis acid sites concentration than for cB-Et. Hierarchical zeolite hB-Et(20) also demonstrates a higher activity (TOFGVL) in GVL formation as in the case of LA conversion. This higher activity for hierarchical Zr-BEA is associated with a large number of strong Lewis acid sites, accounting for 12 % from the total Lewis acid sites concentration (Table S1) in contrast to 5 % for cB-Et, because they are more active in the formation of GVL via MPV reduction. In addition, these strong acid sites, as stated above, are more accessible to bulky reactants and intermediates, since hierarchical zeolite has a larger external surface area (Table 2).",
          "Comparing the results for conversion of LA and BL over hB-Et(20), a higher GVL initial rate is achieved when using BL instead of LA (Tables 5 and 6), since LA can interact with the basic framework oxygen bound to Zr, preventing hydrogen transfer [32].",
          "The reaction pathways for the transformation of BL to GVL are shown in Scheme S3. In addition to the main pathway of direct MPV reduction of BL, the reduction of sec-pentyl LEV also leads to GVL. The selectivity towards butyl 4-hydroxypentanoate decreases with increasing BL conversion (Fig. S14), while other by-products (sec-pentyl LEV, sec-pentyl 4-hydroxypentanoate, butyl 4-(sec-pentyl)pentanoate, butyl 4-butylpentanoate) are formed in small quantities. The experimental MS spectra of butyl 4-hydroxypentanoate, butyl 4-(sec-pentyl)pentanoate and butyl 4-butylpentanoate are given in Figs. S15–S17.",
          "In the transformation of alkyl levulinates (Table S5), hB-Et(20) exhibits a higher catalytic activity than reported Sn-BEA zeolites [24,91] (entries 9, 10, 13), MOF (DUT67(Hf)) [35] and ZrO2 [29]. Slightly lower GVL yield for hB-Et(20) compared to Zr-BEA (Si/Zr = 12) [51] (entry 8) and mechanical mixture (Zr-Y(Si/Zr = 20) + H-Y(Si/Al = 16)) [51] (entry 11) can be explained by a higher catalyst/substrate mass ratio for the reported process (2.08 w/w vs. 0.77 w/w in our case). The difference in catalytic activity of hB-Et(20) and described catalysts (e.g., Zr-BEA, Si/Zr = 127 [93], entry 7) can also be associated with a larger size of BL compared to methyl and ethyl levulinates, which leads to diffusion limitation of a larger molecule (BL) and a lower accessibility of the active sites for BL."

          "The reusability of the most active catalyst hB-Et(20) in the transformation of LA to GVL has been studied (Table S6). The conversion of LA and GVL yield decrease in the 2nd cycle of the process due to the partial blocking of the active sites of the catalyst by the strongly adsorbed products. In addition, the increase in selectivity to GVL in the 2nd cycle of the reaction compared to the 1st cycle (94 % vs. 73 % at 43 % LA conversion, Table S6, Fig. 4) can be associated with the blocking of the Brønsted acid sites responsible for the formation of the by-products, such as sec-pentyl LEV, aldol condensation products. Calcination of the catalyst used in the 2nd cycle at the temperature of 550 °C results in recovery of the catalyst initial activity (3rd and 4th cycles, Table S6) due to the removal of deposits from the catalyst.",
          "According to TG-DSC analysis, hierarchical hB-Et(20) zeolite used in the first run and washed with acetone contains 6.5 % of organic compounds (Fig. S18). In the FTIR spectrum of the spent catalyst evacuated at 150 °C (Fig. S19), the absorption bands at 1705 and 1685 cm−1 are observed, corresponding to stretching vibration of C=O group in carboxylic acid and stretching vibration of the C=C bond in unsaturated compounds [91]. For the spent hB-Et(20) sample, the concentration of Lewis acid sites based on pyridine adsorption is 222 μmol/g, which is lower than for the fresh catalyst containing 330 μmol/g. The spent sample also has a lower concentration of Brønsted acid sites, as compared to the fresh catalyst. According to these results, it can be assumed, that the product of GVL dehydration, which can be unsaturated carboxylic acid, strongly adsorb on Brønsted acid sites located near Lewis acid sites decreasing their accessibility for the reagents. This partial blocking of the Lewis acid sites may be the reason for decreasing overall activity of the catalyst in the 2nd cycle of the reaction. Calcination of the spent catalyst leads to the recovery of its catalytic activity due to the removal of unsaturated carboxylic acid."

          "The novel approach for obtaining hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites with various Si/Zr ratio and enhanced external surface area has been proposed. This approach is based on a two-step post-synthetic method involving dealumination of hierarchical Al-BEA obtained in highly concentrated reaction mixture followed by zirconium incorporation by wet impregnation. The highest zirconium incorporation degree of 42 % is achieved when using hierarchical zeolite as a parent material, zirconium (IV) chloride as a zirconium source and dry ethanol as a solvent. The presence of mesopores in hierarchical zeolites improves diffusion of ZrCl4 to the silanol nests of framework vacancies with the formation of Zr–O (framework) bonds and incorporation of zirconium. A higher solubility of ZrCl4 in ethanol as compared to 2-propanol increases the dispersion of zirconium atoms in the final material.",
          "Hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites demonstrate high catalytic activity, selectivity and reusability in the transformation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone under mild reaction conditions (115 °C, atmospheric pressure). The hB-Et(20) catalyst with the highest concentration of strong Lewis acid sites and moderate concentration of Brønsted acid sites provides a high initial rate of γ-valerolactone formation and allows to obtain 98 % γ-valerolactone yield after 24 h of reaction. The strong Lewis acid sites are the most active in the direct MPV reduction of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone, while Brønsted acid sites promote the formation of sec-pentyl levulinate as an intermediate by-product and a longer reaction time is required to increase γ-valerolactone yield. Hierarchical Zr-BEA zeolites are more efficient catalyst than commercially-based Zr-BEA due to a larger external surface area resulted in the improved accessibility of Lewis acid sites for the reactants. A higher initial rate of γ-valerolactone formation is achieved when using butyl levulinate, since levulinic acid could interact with the basic framework oxygen of active complex, preventing hydrogen transfer. A plausible mechanism for the formation of γ-valerolactone and by-products from levulinic acid and butyl levulinate over Lewis and Brønsted acid sites has been proposed and discussed."

    "abstract": "The development of robust nickel catalysts on porous substrates offers great potential for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into methane, thereby helping to address the global warming and sustainability challenges. This study investigates the dispersion and stability of Ni nanolayers by grafting bifunctional groups over the hierarchical zeolite 13X (h13X) support using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). The Ni nanolayers, with a thickness of 1.5–7 nm, were deposited around the edges of h13X and analyzed using STEM imaging. A clear shift in the binding energies was observed by XPS analysis, substantiating the enhanced metal-support interaction (MSI) between NiO and h13X. The influence of reaction temperature on APTES incorporation into h13X was revealed by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD, with notable variations in the reducibility and surface basicity profiles of the catalysts. The optimized catalyst exhibited CO2 conversion of 61 % with CH4 selectivity of 97 % under GHSV of 60,000 mlgCat\n                     -1h-1 at 400 °C and 1 bar and demonstrated robust stability over a period of 150 h without discernible degradation. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the strengthened MSI and reduced size of Ni nanolayers over h13X. These findings highlight the development of robust heterogeneous catalysts by changing the surface chemistry of support material for various catalytic applications.",

        "content": [
          "Global warming is a significant challenge, primarily driven by rising emissions of carbon dioxide. To achieve net-zero targets, enhancing carbon capture and utilization (CCU) efforts is essential (Prasad et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2019). Heterogeneous catalytic processes enable the transformation of CO2 into various chemicals, including methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO). Catalytic conversion of CO2 into CH4 is widely carried out using nickel-based catalysts. However, deactivation due to sintering and coking presents significant challenges in developing stable Ni catalysts (Su and Shen, 2024). Coking is the reversible degradation of the catalytic activity due to blockage of the active sites caused by the accumulation of carbon species on the catalyst's surface, whereas sintering causes an irreversible loss of catalytic activity due to the aggregation of nanoparticles (Gao et al., 2020).",
          "Resistance to the thermal sintering can be tuned by regulating the metal-support interaction (MSI), tailoring the size of nanoparticles and confinement into pores of support materials, thereby preventing the recombination of Ni species (Gao et al., 2021). The mesoporous support provides better confinement for active metal particles than microporous materials. However, even confined particles can pop out at higher temperatures during the reduction of NiO to Ni and under reaction conditions (Kantorovich et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2012). The strength of the interfacial bonding determines the resistance against the sintering, and the characteristics of the supporting material determine how effective MSI, particle size, and Ni distribution would be. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth metals as a promoter has been extensively studied to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles, strengthening of metal-support interfacial bonding, and stability of catalysts (Wang et al., 2018). The promoters affect CO2 adsorption and activation, contributing to enhanced catalysis (Arbag et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2024). For example, adding Mg into various Ni-supported catalysts has been reported to enhance the dispersion of Ni and CO2 activation, leading to improved catalytic performance (Baysal and Kureti, 2020). Bacariza et al.(Bacariza et al., 2017) reported the enhanced activity of MgO-promoted Ni/USY zeolites catalyst owing to increased dispersion of Ni and enhanced CO2 activation. The MSI also influences the selectivity of the CH4 by affecting the spillover of H• from Ni to support for hydrogenation of the adsorbed species (Ashok et al., 2017). However, adding promoters like Mg can also develop a solid solution with Ni and render it an inactive catalyst (Burger et al., 2018).",
          "In addition, the dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and MSI can be tuned by modifying the surface chemistry of support. Attaching the functional groups on the surface of the support material can influence the MSI and regulate the size of nanoparticles (Deka et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2015a). Surface functionalization with amine groups reportedly facilitates the anchoring of Ni species over support. The nature and availability of amine groups are crucial for ensuring uniform dispersion and controlling the size and distribution of Ni nanoparticles, as they influence the nucleation process. The amine functional groups grafted into the pores or terminal edges increase the local basicity, thereby promoting the regioselective nucleation and precipitation and serving as anchoring sites for the Ni nanoparticles. Cho et al. (Cho et al., 2017) achieved monodisperse Ni nanoparticles supported over MFI zeolite nanosponge by using trimethyl[3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl]ammonium hydroxide as a functionalizing agent. The ammonium species embedded into the mesopores of MFI promoted the regioselective nucleation and precipitation of Ni through interaction with silanol groups. In addition, a bifunctional group can tailor the MSI and size of nanoparticles more effectively. Especially in the case of zeolites, bifunctional groups containing amines and silanol groups could be advantageous owing to their stronger interaction with support through silanol groups via the silylation mechanism and availability of amines for Ni attachment (Yang et al., 2020). The impact of functionalization depends on several parameters, including the coordination environment of the zeolite framework, pore size, nature of the functionalizing agent, solvent, and temperature of the functionalizing process (Liu and Corma, 2021; Sypabekova et al., 2022; Vrijburg et al., 2019). The aforementioned approaches worked well for mesoporous support materials but may have limitations when applied to microporous support materials. Due to the limited pore size, growing nanoparticles inside the pores can lead to blockage and reduced surface area of the catalysts, subsequently affecting the diffusion dynamics for catalytic performance (Perego and Millinib, 2013; Prieto et al., 2014). The nanoparticles supported on microporous materials are susceptible to aggregation at elevated loadings, primarily due to surface deposition. At high temperatures, these nanoparticles experience significant sintering, which further aggravates the challenges associated with maintaining proper dispersion (Aijaz and Xu, 2014; Dai et al., 2018).",
          "This study focused on exploring the role of functional groups in regulating the metal-support interaction and dispersion of Ni over the hierarchical zeolite 13X (h13X). By introducing the surface functionalities, the growth of Ni can be redirected and regulated in terms of size, position, and dispersion. The h13X support was functionalized with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane) (APTES) before Ni loading. The optimization of APTES loading and temperature of functionalization, along with their impact on metal-support interaction, was analyzed. The functionalization promoted the preferential growth of Ni nanolayers around the edges of h13X crystals, which was witnessed by STEM and HRTEM. The synthesized catalysts were thoroughly characterized and evaluated for CO2 methanation."

For the TEM study, the samples were dispersed on Cu TEM grids with holey carbon supporting films. A double aberration-corrected Thermo Fisher Themis Z equipped with a Super-X EDS detector was used for scanning TEM (STEM) imaging and EDS experiments. The electron microscope was operated at 300 kV, and aberrations were corrected up to 5th order. The beam semi-convergence angle of 21 mrad and probe current of 120 pA were applied for imaging and EDS analysis. To investigate the particle morphology and elemental distribution of samples, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and bright-field STEM (BF-STEM) images were acquired using a Fischione ADF detector and Thermo Fisher BF detector, respectively. The collection angle of HAADF- and BF-STEM images was 63–200 mrad and below 35 mrad, respectively. STEM imaging and EDS acquisition and analysis were performed using a Thermo Fisher Velox. For EDS elemental mapping, integration of frames and drift correction were applied in order to minimize beam damage and enhance the signals. The acquisition time of each frame was about 10 ms, and the integration time for each elemental map was about 5 min. For the STEM-EELS study, the acquisition and data analysis were performed using the Gatan Microscopy Suite. The EELS spectrometer used was the Gatan Imaging Filter (Quantum ER). TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired by a Gatan Oneview camera.",
          "The crystallinity of the samples was determined using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu K-α radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) (Empyrean, PANalytical, United Kingdom). The thermal stability of the catalysts was investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer equipped with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC, SDT 650, TA Instruments, USA) at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min under an argon (Ar) atmosphere. The H2-TPR and CO2-TPD experiments were conducted using a calibrated ChemBET Pulsar (AntonPar) connected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typically, 50 mg of sample was loaded into a quartz U-shaped reactor, and the reducibility profile was recorded using 10 % H2/N2 up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. For CO2-TPD, 50 mg of each sample was pre-reduced in 10 % H2/N2 gas at 400 °C using a heating rate of 10 °C/min and cooled under the He atmosphere (30 ml/min). The pre-reduced samples were exposed to 10 % CO2/N2 for 45 min. Then, the physisorbed CO2 species were flushed out using He for 30 min. The chemisorbed CO2-TPD profile was recorded continuously using a heating rate of 20 °C/min up to 600 °C in the He flow. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer using a monochromated Al Ka source operated at 150 W. Analyser pass energy of 160 eV for acquiring wide spectra and a pass energy of 20 eV for individual photoelectron lines were used. The surface potential was stabilized by the spectrometer charge neutralization system. The binding energy (BE) scale was referenced to the C_1s line of aliphatic carbon, set at 285.0 eV. Processing of the spectra was accomplished with the Kratos software. The powder sample for the analysis was gently hand-pressed into a pellet directly on a sample holder using a clean Ni spatula. The surface area and pore volume were evaluated using the N2-physisorption measurements with the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus instrument.

A 100 mg catalyst diluted with 1 g of quartz sand was loaded in the quartz glass tube, supported by glass wool at both the top and bottom. A leak test was performed at 10 bar for 10 min to ensure no gas leakage. The catalysts were reduced at 500 °C before the reaction under a 20 % H2/N2 gas mixture for one hour.

          "The zeolite frameworks are characterized by various structural and surface defects, specifically connecting anomalies and external silanol sites. Inducing hierarchical porosity in the zeolite framework amplifies the density of defects, and generally, these defective sites are located around the edges and boundaries of the crystals. Grafting functional groups to those sites can make them more reactive and could be effective in the deposition of Ni nanoparticles. Loading of silane functional groups made h13X defect sites more attractive to Ni nanoparticles owing to the terminal amine species offered by APTES. During calcination, it facilitated the impregnation of Ni nanoparticles around the edges through Si-O-Ni bonding, resulting in nanolayer-like structures. The catalysts were analyzed using STEM and EDS. Fig. 1 shows the morphology of the optimized AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X) catalyst. In the HAADF- and BF-STEM images shown in Fig. 1 (a,d), it can be observed that the Ni is deposited in the form of nanolayers around the edges of zeolite h13X. Brighter contrasts can be found at the edges or boundary of the h13X crystals, indicating the presence of heavier elements. Fig. 1 (b, e) shows the high-resolution STEM images of the catalyst, where lattice fringes can be clearly observed in both the bright-field and dark-field contrast regions. As a result, these indicated that a higher amount of Ni was located at the edge or boundary of the h13X crystals. Further, the Ni nanolayer around the edges of the crystal was confirmed by the STEM-EELS, as shown in Fig. 1 (c, f). The EELS image of Ni L2,3 edge revealed that Ni was deposited as nanolayers and exhibited some surface deposition as well. In addition, high-resolution TEM images were also recorded to further analyze the anchoring of Ni across the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2 (a, b). The high-magnification TEM images revealed that Ni is layered around the boundaries or edges of zeolite h13X. Lattice fringes of Ni were also observed in the TEM images. The nanolayers were exceedingly thin, 1.5–7 nm, indicating even distribution. The growth of Ni nanolayers around the crystal edges with obvious MSI can be attributed to the APTES functionalization of h13X, which created the selective anchoring sites. For comparison, pristine Ni/h13X was analyzed using HAADF and BF-STEM, and the results are shown in Fig. S2(a-d). It shows that Ni was mainly distributed as nanoparticles. Meanwhile, some Ni is also present in the form of nanolayers, which confirms the role of defects in depositing Ni around the edges of h13X. This further indicated that adding APTES promoted the growth of Ni around the edges of the crystals in the functionalized catalyst compared to the pristine Ni/h13X. Furthermore, the h13X support was analyzed using HAADF and BF-STEM, as shown in Fig. S3(a, b). The images showed the crystal of h13X without any significant brighter contrast contributed by heavy elements, thereby, supporting the above discussion regarding the confirmation of Ni nanolayers on the edges of the h13X in the catalyst.",
          "The STEM-EDS mapping was applied to further examine the elemental composition of the catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3 . The Ni was well distributed across the h13X crystals, which was not clearly revealed by the HAADF-STEM or TEM images. The results suggested that Ni, in fact, was present everywhere in the crystals. In the projected image, which contributed to the bright contrasts in HAADF-STEM, the edges could have more Ni along the electron beam direction. Therefore, in addition to growth on the edges, Ni was also present on the surface, as confirmed by the STEM-EDS maps. Furthermore, the elemental composition of the catalysts was analyzed using ICP, and the results are presented in Table 1 . The composition of the Ni in the catalysts was close to the theoretical values, suggesting successful impregnation over the h13X support. There is an increase in Si contents compared to Ni/h13X, indicating the loading of APTES species into the h13X.",
          "To evaluate the impact of functionalization on MSI and how the reaction temperature impacted the strength of bonding relative to the pristine catalyst, changes in the binding energies, surface composition, and the elemental states of elements catalyst were studied using XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 4 . The Si_2p spectra showed a peak at 102.9 eV, corresponding to the tetrahedral structure of SiO2 within the zeolite framework (Gong et al., 2023). The O_1s spectra displayed two peaks at 529.7 eV and 531.9 eV, suggesting the presence of oxygen within the zeolite framework associated with Si-O-Al, Si-O-Si, and Ni-O bonds (Walkowiak et al., 2020). In addition, there was a minor peak at 533.3 eV, which suggests the presence of -C-O bonds, thereby confirming the incorporation of APTES species. The presence of APTES was further supported by the nitrogen (N) spectrum, which exhibited peaks at 398.4 eV and 400.8 eV, corresponding to -NH2 and HNC species from APTES. The Ni_2p spectrum showed two peaks at 854.5 eV and 856.5 eV, respectively. The small peak at 854.5 eV can be attributed to surface NiO species on the support. The main peak at 856.5 eV indicated the strong interaction of NiO with the h13X framework, possibly due to Si-O-Si-Ni bonding (He et al., 2024). The peaks at 871.9 eV and 874.0 eV represented the Ni_2p1/2, confirming the presence of Ni2+ as NiO (Sun et al., 2019). According to the literature, pure nickel oxide (NiO) exhibits a binding energy of approximately 854.0 eV (Peck and Langell, 2012). Variations in binding energies of Ni_2p suggested a significant MSI between NiO and h13X, particularly increased binding energy values of peaks at 854.5 eV and 856.5 eV. With increases in the functionalization temperature, there was a notable enhancement in the intensity of the peaks at 854.5 eV and 871.0 eV, as demonstrated by Ni_2p spectrum of AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X in Fig. 4 (e), which could be ascribed to the rise in the population of surface Ni species owing to surface integrated APTES over h13X. Furthermore, the pristine Ni/h13X catalyst also exhibited a small peak at 854.0 eV, as shown in Fig. 4 (f). The observed shift in the binding energy to a lower value (from 854.5 eV in functionalized catalysts) emphasized the critical role of APTES in strengthening the MSI between NiO and h1X support. Furthermore, the area of peak at 854.5 eV in AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X spectrum constituted 23 % of the total Ni_2p3/2 peaks area (encompassing both 854.5 eV and 856.5 eV), which was two-fold higher compared to AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X catalyst, indicating a significant rise in the surface species. This underscores the importance of determining an optimal functionalization temperature for stronger MSI. The average spin-orbital energy differences for Ni_2p3/2 and Ni_2p1/2 were about 17.5 eV for AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X and 17.2 eV for AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X as shown in Fig. 4 (d, e). The increased spin-orbital energy difference indicated the stronger MSI between NiO and the support under optimized functionalization conditions (Horlyck et al., 2018). Further, surface composition measured by XPS showed an enhanced Si/Al ratio of 1.7 for the AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X compared to 1.6 and 1.3 for the AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X and Ni/h13X, respectively. These findings, correlated with STEM and TEM, highlighting the MSI resulting from the incorporation of siloxane in the catalysts.",
          "The crystallinity of the prepared catalysts was investigated using XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The XRD pattern showed the distinct peaks at 2θ values of 6°, 10°, 15°, 18°, 20°, 23.5°, 27°, and 31°, indicative of the crystalline structure, characteristic of zeolite 13X (Wei et al., 2020). The main peak at 6° displayed a relatively low intensity for functionalized catalysts, likely attributed to Ni nanolayers and the incorporation of APTES into the h13X framework. The Ni/h13X exhibited small peaks at 43.1° and 62.7°, corresponding to the (200) and (220) planes of NiO (Cai et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the intensities of NiO peaks were diminished in the functionalized catalysts, possibly due to the uniform distribution, thin nanolayers, and poor crystallinity of NiO, as observed in the TEM and STEM images (Beierlein et al., 2019). One must note the limitation of the XRD instrument, which cannot detect crystallite sizes lower than 4 nm (Shetty et al., 2015).",
          "The thermal stability of the catalysts was evaluated using TGA-DSC analysis, as shown in Fig. 5 (b, c). The TGA curves for the catalysts exhibited weight loss at temperatures below 250 °C, indicating the desorption of surface-adsorbed moisture. A further minor mass loss was observed in the temperature range of 400–600 °C, likely attributable to the removal of strongly bound water molecules within the zeolite h13X cages, suggesting the dehydration of the framework (Zhou et al., 2013a)(Waseem et al., 2011). Different catalysts exhibited varying amounts of bound water molecules, which may be related to the handling of samples and exposure to open air before analysis, especially for pristine Ni/h13X, which was always stored in a desiccator. The TGA mass loss events were complemented by a DSC analysis, which revealed endothermic events corresponding to the removal of moisture from the catalysts. An additional peak was observed in the DSC curves, approximately at 760–800 °C, which indicates the collapse of the h13X framework structure at higher temperatures (Park et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2013b). Overall, the catalysts exhibited remarkable stability up to 750 °C, which is quite high compared to the thermal conditions applied for CO2 methanation.",
          "To evaluate the reducibility of the active metal, TPR analysis was performed, as shown in Fig. 5 (d). Two major peaks were observed for all catalysts corresponding to surface and strongly attached NiO particles (Garbarino et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2021). The primary peak observed at approximately 400 °C suggests the presence of surface-bonded NiO over the supporting h13X. Notably, the peak intensities exhibited variability that could be correlated with the differing molar ratios of APTES to Ni (0, 1, 1.5, and 2). As the APTES loading was elevated, the peak profile underwent significant evolution, displaying pronounced broadening characteristics. The AF(2)-Ni/h13X and AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X catalysts displayed significantly broader reduction peaks, initiating around 300 °C and stretching up to approximately 600 °C. Excessive utilization of APTES could result in the saturation of silanol groups, leading to multilayer deposition on the support, subsequently promoting surface proliferation and leading to a broader dispersion of Ni nanoparticles. The surface basicity of the catalysts was assessed using the CO2-TPD technique, as shown in Fig. 5 (e). All the catalysts exhibited a prominent peak below 150 °C, likely attributed to weakly associated CO2 in the form of bicarbonates on the surface of h13X (Kuhaudomlap et al., 2024). The functionalized catalysts exhibited an additional shoulder between 150–200 °C, likely attributed to the altered desorption characteristics of weakly adsorbed CO2 resulting from the presence of APTES species. Moreover, another peak appeared in the range of 250–450 °C, with the specific peak positions varying according to the catalyst composition. The observed peak suggests an attachment of CO2, likely attributed to the incorporation of Ni in the catalysts. Notably, AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X prepared at a higher functionalization temperature exhibited no peaks in this range, indicating no physical adsorption; instead, it showed a small, broad peak in the 400–600 °C range. It is believed that this unusual pattern can be attributed to the coverage of certain Ni by excessive siloxane deposition, resulting in surface hydrophobicity, which may arise from the hydrolysis of APTES (Gorbounov et al., 2024). This hydrophobic siloxane coating hindered CO2 adsorption by obstructing available binding sites (Liu et al., 2020). These results underscore the importance of temperature during the functionalization process for the effective attachment of APTES.",
          "The textural properties of the catalyst are important to estimate the sorption and desorption dynamics during the reaction. Fig. 5 (f) presents the N2 sorption and desorption isotherms of the synthesized catalysts. The sorption curves revealed steep adsorption at lower pressures, indicative of microporous materials, along with an increase in N2 sorption at higher relative pressures, suggesting the presence of mesopores. Overall, the sorption and desorption isotherms conform to type IV according to the IUPAC classification, demonstrating the coexistence of micro and mesopores within the hierarchical 13X structure. The presence of mesopores could facilitate mass transport, enabling faster adsorption and desorption of reaction species, which would be advantageous for catalytic CO2 methanation. The external surface area, along with the mesopore and micropore volumes of the different catalysts, is summarized in Table 2 . As the loading of functional groups increased, the volume of mesopores decreased, suggesting that the enhanced layering of nanoparticles may be obstructing certain pore openings (Ponomarenko et al., 2010). Notably, the AF(2)-Ni/h13X exhibited a significant decrease in mesopore volume relative to the other catalysts, which could be ascribed to an overabundance of APTES groups localized over h13X support. Post-optimal loading of APTES over h13X demonstrated diminishing returns, as additional amounts adversely affected the textural properties and could compromise the catalyst's performance."

          "The catalysts performance was evaluated for CO2 conversion to CH4 in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 (a), the CO2 conversion exhibited variation with respect to temperature. Regardless of the catalyst, CO2 conversion was increased with temperature until it reached maximum conversion. At this point, all the catalysts demonstrated comparable conversion activity. The initial increase in conversion with temperature was attributed to a higher rate constant at elevated temperatures and the kinetic limitation of CO2 conversion (Safdar et al., 2024). However, further increases in temperature showed a negligible impact on the rate constant and, consequently, on CO2 conversion. Among the studied catalysts, AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X demonstrated a maximum conversion of 61 %, substantially higher than the pristine Ni/h13X, which achieved a CO2 conversion of 46.6 % at 400 °C. The increase in CO2 conversion followed the order: AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X > AF(1)-Ni/h13X > AF(2)-Ni/h13X > AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X > Ni/h13X at 400 °C. Notably, all the functionalized catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity compared to the pristine Ni/h13X at temperatures above 400 °C. The optimized catalyst, with an APTES/Ni molar ratio of 1.5/1, consistently maintained the highest conversion across the temperature spectrum. For instance, at a lower temperature of 250 °C, AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X showed a conversion of approximately 6 %, two times higher than the pristine Ni/h13X catalyst. Likewise, at 350 °C, CO2 conversion was 47 %, two-fold higher than the Ni/h13X catalyst. This proves that functionalization improved the CO2 conversion capability of the catalysts, which could be ascribed to better dispersion, stronger MSI, and controlled size of the Ni nanolayers (Gao et al., 2015a). Comparing the performance of functionalized catalysts, it is evident that after optimum value, further loading of functional groups led to reduced CO2 conversion. The BET surface area was also noted to be lower for the AF(2)-Ni/h13X catalyst, likely resulting from pore blockage caused by the surplus APTES, which remained as inactive species as well as limiting the access to the active sites. The differences in the catalytic activity could further be correlated with the CO2-TPD analysis. The CO2 TPD results showed a poor profile, especially for AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X. Despite the high surface area, there was no CO2 desorption peak below 400 °C, indicating poor CO2 sorption characteristics and, consequently, lower performance. This shows that surface area may not only be really associated with higher catalytic CO2 methanation (Varvoutis et al., 2021). Surprisingly at a temperature above 400 °C, the performance of the AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X was better than the pristine Ni/h13X catalyst, which can also be correlated with CO2-TPD results where a broader CO2 desorption peak was observed at high temperatures. This showed that incorporation of APTES affected the surface characteristics and performance of the catalyst across the range of temperatures.",
          "Furthermore, the selectivity of the product closely mirrored the CO2 conversion profiles demonstrated by different catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (b). The AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X showed a higher selectivity of CH4 across the studied temperature range. The selectivity was slightly decreased in the range of 275–325 °C, which might be due to Ni carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) formation and carbonyl species without being hydrogenated to CH4, leading to marginally increased CO formation (Galhardo et al., 2021; Quindimil et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020). Additionally, CO formation began to rise after reaching 400 °C, suggesting the triggering of the reverse water-gas shift reaction at higher temperatures. As temperature exceeded 425 °C, CO2 conversion reached maximum value, while the product selectivity continued to vary, with a notable increase in CO formation. Notably, the disparity in CH4 selectivity among the functionalized catalysts diminished at elevated temperatures. At 550 °C, the CH4 selectivity reached a point of near equivalence across all the tested catalysts. These observations underscore the significant impact of the nature of the catalyst and temperature on both product selectivity and conversion rates.",
          "The catalysts were further subject to stability analysis for 50 h, as shown in Fig. 6 (c). All the catalysts exhibited comparable stability during the reaction under elevated conditions. The activity of the AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X catalyst slightly decreased in the first 24 h by 6 % and reached a steady state. The AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X exhibited a higher loss in catalytic activity than other catalysts. Activity loss of ∼8 % was observed during the first 24 h, showing relative instability. Although it showed slightly reduced performance, the AF(1)-Ni/h13X exhibited only a 3 % decrease in catalytic performance, demonstrating stability and robustness. The AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X catalyst was further evaluated for long-term stability analysis over 150 h, as shown in Fig. 6 (d). The catalyst demonstrated no further loss of activity, indicating its robustness and resilience against sintering and coking. The activity loss during the initial CO2 conversion could be associated with the sintering of the catalyst, which has been reported to degrade the active sites speedily at the early stages of the time-on-stream analysis. The sintering mechanism can be divided into three main stages. The first stage, where the catalyst activity decreases quickly, could be due to the aggregation of extremely small nanoparticles owing to the difference in surface energy, coalescing themselves into bigger particles. The aggregation of weakly bonded nanoparticles is known as the Ostwald ripening effect (Hansen et al., 2013). This could be related to surface Ni, as revealed by STEM-EDS mapping. Challa et al. (Challa et al., 2011) studied the sintering of Ni nanoparticles supported over MgAl2O4 using in-situ TEM analysis under the H2 and H2O species, considering the steam reforming reaction. It was observed that the small nanoparticles disappeared rapidly, whereas bigger nanoparticles remained unaffected during the reaction, indicating that the rapid loss of activity at the early stage of the stability test could be due to the Ostwald ripening effect (Challa et al., 2011). Likewise, Sadeqzadeh et al. (Sadeqzadeh et al., 2013) evaluated the deactivation of Co-supported over Al2O3 due to sintering. They found that the decrease in catalytic activity was due to increased crystallites size at the early stages of deactivation during the first day of the reaction. Therefore, the decreased activity can be attributed to the sintering of Ni nanoparticles on the support material. The presence of surface-associated Ni species was also revealed in the XPS analysis, explaining the expected sintering of the catalyst at the early stages of the reaction. Higher degradation of the AF(1.5″)-Ni/h13X could be explained by a great number of surface-bounded particles as observed in the XPS peaks. Additionally, Fig. 6 (e) shows the selectivity of the product during the time-on-stream experiment. It shows that the selectivity of CH4 was largely unchanged with time. Ni-based catalysts have been reported for the selective production of CH4 (Aziz et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015b). Carefully evaluating the results of the long-term stability analysis, the selectivity of CH4 decreased slightly during the first 12 h and then remained unchanged, mirroring the CO2 conversion pattern. This showed that the size of Ni nanoparticles had a profound impact on the selectivity of product (Garbarino et al., 2014; Kesavan et al., 2018).",
          "The spent catalysts were analyzed after a 50 h stability analysis to evaluate coke formation using TGA under air, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 (f). The samples showed a decrease in mass below 250 °C, which corresponded to the removal of moisture. There was an increase in the range of 250–400 °C mass, originating from the oxidation of Ni to NiO. A slight decrease in mass was observed between 400–600 °C, indicating the dehydration of h13X. These results demonstrated that APTES loading enhanced the MSI, resulting in effective CO2 methanation without coke formation. The spent catalysts were further analyzed using Raman spectroscopy to identify the carbon deposition. As shown in Fig. S4, no signals were observed for carbon deposition in any of the catalysts, with the main peaks corresponding to quartz sand and weak signals for the zeolites. This supports the TGA findings and confirms the resilience of the catalysts against coking. These results also support the AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X stability analysis, which demonstrated good stability for 150 h at 400 °C under reaction conditions.",
          "The mechanism of CO2 methanation relies on various factors, including the catalysts used, supporting material, textural characteristics, and size of the Ni nanoparticles (Zhu et al., 2021). Regardless, the initial stage involves the adsorption of CO2, which is succeeded by its activation. The adsorbed CO2 can be transformed into CH4 through various routes, including associated CO2 methanation and dissociative CO2 methanation. Associated mechanisms proceed via the generation of formate (HCOO-) species from the reaction between adsorbed CO2 and H species, which are further hydrogenated into CH4. Alternatively, CO2 can be dissociated into •CO and O•, and the •CO further dissociates into •C species, which react with H• to generate CH4. However, the formation of formate species is energetically more favorable compared to the dissociation of CO2 into •CO, but the transformation of formate into CHO and O is much more difficult than the dissociation of CO2 into CO and O (Cao et al., 2009). Ren et al. (Ren et al., 2015) investigated the mechanism of CO2 methanation using DFT, considering all the possible routes. They found that the dissociation of CO2 into CO + C showed a lower energy barrier (237.4 kJ/mol) compared to HCOO- into CO + OH (306 kJ/mol). However, the investigation did not consider the reverse water-gas reaction, where CO can be hydrogenated into CO2 and H2. The peaks in CO2-TPD (Fig. 5 (e)) at high temperatures indicate that formate species could be promoted by the interaction between CO2 and H on the surface of Ni via the associated CO2 mechanism. The higher CH4 selectivity (Fig. 6 (e)) also supports the formate route, which is energetically more feasible than the dissociative mechanism (Li et al., 2022). Particularly, H-spillover in zeolite-based catalysts positively affects the CH4 selectivity by reducing the adsorbed CO2 into an active formate intermediate. Thus, formate species can arise from the reaction between adsorbed CO2 and H as CO 2 − + H → HCOO − , which would react with H on the surface of Ni illustrated in Fig. 7 . Formate could dissociate into C via the CO route or be directly hydrogenated into CH4. Westermann et al. (Westermann et al., 2015) investigated the mechanistic of CO2 methanation over Ni/USY catalyst and observed that the concentrations of formate ions decreased at high temperatures compared to •CO formation, indicating the consumption of formate species owing to the increased rate of hydrogenation at high temperatures. This highlighted that formate species were dissociated into •CO and pointed the associated mechanism. Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2018) reported the formation of carbonate species, which were converted into bicarbonate by reacting with OH• and further into formate ions on the surface of Ni. Thus, the higher CH4 selectivity observed in this study could be attributed to the formate pathway."

          "In summary, this study reported the development of Ni nanolayers and the optimization of functional group loading over the hierarchical zeolite 13X for catalytic CO2 methanation. The regioselective grafting of Ni nanolayers over h13X was observed in the STEM and HRTEM images. The surface characteristics of the catalysts were modified as revealed by H2-TPR and CO2-TPD analysis. A shift in the binding energies was observed upon the addition of APTES and changing the functionalization temperature, underscoring the importance of optimized parameters to develop a stronger MSI between NiO and h13X. The AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X catalyst, with an optimized loading of amine and silanol groups, exhibited the highest CO2 conversion of 61 % and a CH4 selectivity of approximately 97 %, significantly higher than that of the pristine Ni/h13X. The AF(1.5)-Ni/h13X catalyst demonstrated stability for 150 h without discernible degradation in the CO2 conversion. Overall, the enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the improved metal-support interaction and reduced size of NiO nanolayers over hierarchical zeolite 13X, owing to the optimized loading of APTES and functionalization conditions."

    "abstract": "Herein we report on the design of hierarchical zeolite supraparticles from hydrothermally-derived 100 nm TS-1 zeolite nanoparticles (NPs) by means of spray-drying. These supraparticles, with a large surface area (up to 678 m2/g), possess a biporous structure that is composed of zeolitic micropores (0.9–1.1 nm) and secondary mesopores. Depending on the synthesis conditions, it is possible to prepare supraparticles, formed by separate NPs and wide (50 nm) interparticular pores or by zeolitic NPs, tightly glued together by amorphous mesoporous titanosilicate. According to the UV–vis spectrometry data and FTIR studies of adsorbed pyridine, the active sites of “separated” supraparticles are presented mainly by Lewis sites associated with [TiO4] species isolated in the zeolite matrix, while “glued” supraparticles possess a significant fraction of [TiO5] and [TiO6] species.\n                  The supraparticles demonstrate sufficiently high catalytic activity in the industrially valuable two-stage synthesis of cyclic carbonate (4-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one) from styrene and carbon dioxide, in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant and tetrabutylammonium iodide as a co-catalyst. We found that the selectivity to the target cyclic carbonate increased with an external specific surface area growth, probably due to the facilitated withdrawal of reaction products from the zeolite pores.",

        "content": [
          "Zeolites as a broad class of natural as well as synthetic crystalline porous materials possess diverse well-ordered structures and different chemical compositions, accompanied with high thermal stability and the ability to act as molecular sieves [1,2]. They are widely used in numerous industrial applications, including sorption, ion exchange, separation/purification processes, petrochemistry, fine organic synthesis and others, not in the last turn due to their environmentally ‘green’ character, nontoxicity and safe operation. One of the most prominent properties of zeolites is their catalytic activity in a wide range of chemical reactions [2].",
          "However, the catalytic application of zeolites has several limitations caused by the zeolite microporosity. Bulky substrate molecules can access only the active sites on the external surface of a zeolite particle; for smaller molecules, the diffusion transport within the catalyst particle is crucial. One of the strategies to overcome these limitations is the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites.",
          "Hierarchical zeolites, successfully studied for the last two decades, combine microporous entities and the organization of the primary zeolite units into secondary ordered structures [3]. Their secondary ordering leads to the formation of broader transport pores, which overcomes steric hindrances and brings to these materials enhanced catalytic activity or even causes activity in reactions with bulky substrates, non-active with standard zeolites [4].",
          "Several approaches to creating hierarchical zeolite structures are known [5], including top-down and bottom-up routes [6] or their combinations. The most-known top-down routes are dealumination, desilication and dissolution-recrystallization in liquid or dry state; all these procedures may cause a partial loss of the zeolite crystallinity and a degradation of their catalytic activity as a result. The bottom-up route to hierarchical zeolites includes the formation of secondary pores during the synthesis, typically with the aid of soft or hard templates. Mixtures of two structure-directing agents (SDA) for micro- and mesoporosity generation (for example, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and long-chain trimethylammonium salts [7–9]) or complex customized surfactants could be used as soft templates to create hierarchical biporous zeolites [10,11]. These approaches were successfully used to produce a wide range of hierarchical zeolites with controllable morphology, tunable pore size, and good catalytic performance in numerous reactions. Nevertheless, the bottom-up way has also some disadvantages, such as the high cost of customized templates and problems with the scalability of the synthesis. So, the development of effective hierarchical zeolite productions, overcoming the aforementioned limits, is still an actual task [12].",
          "Spray-drying is an effective technique allowing the production of large amounts of different types of materials in the form of nearly spherical micron-size particles, which is particularly advantageous for their further application in heterogeneous catalysis [13,14]. This technique consists of atomization of the solution or slurry into the small droplets, followed by their rapid drying by a hot gas stream inside the drying column. The complexity of the processes with flexible and tunable parameters, taking place during spray-drying, allows not only the formation of new materials by the agglomeration of individual particles but also their chemical transformation by the reactions inside the column, which are fast in time scale and take place at unusual conditions. That's why it is extremely interesting to apply this method to the creation of hierarchical materials. In an ideal case, spray-drying can simulate conditions of hydrothermal synthesis in small droplets, where processes of crystallization, condensation and growth of primary particles take place at the same time.",
          "An analysis of the literature reveals a variety of attempts to apply this technique for different systems, e.g., for hierarchical zeolites. Secondary porosity (or mesoporosity) can be created by several pathways, which in general are similar to the aforementioned strategies for hierarchical zeolites. Despite the variety of zeolite structures, the scope of zeolites used for spray-drying in most cases only includes the well-known ZSM-5 with MFI topology [15–18], the composite of ZSM-5 with zeolite beta [19], zeolite-like imidazolium MOFs [20] and a few others.",
          "Mineral or organic materials can be used as binders for the development of hierarchical structures based on well-formed primary zeolite particles. Particularly, spray-drying of Al-ZSM-5 zeolite in combination with different binders e.g. Ludox-HS-40 colloidal silica, boehmite, and aluminum chlorohydrate [18] allows to obtain 30–100 μm size spherical particles with tunable catalytic activity in methanol-to-olefins conversion processes. Also, biporous matrixes including ZSM-5 can be formed directly via spray-drying a sol that contains pre-formed zeolite nanocrystals and an additional template (e.g., Pluronic F127 co-polymer) for forming mesopores [21] or by a post-synthetic treatment of zeolite-containing supraparticles [15,19].",
          "An application of zeolite nano-size crystallites is an encouraging bottom-up strategy for the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites [15,22], allows for the introduction of advantageous mesoporosity (low diffusion limitations and high external surface of catalytically-active zeolite particles, available for bulky organic substrates) into zeolite catalysts. The effect of mesoporosity-induced enhancement of catalytic activity in epoxidation [23], ammoximation [24], desulfurization [25] and other oxidative reactions was demonstrated for TS-1 zeolites, containing tetrahedral TiO4 sites stabilized in the MFI siliceous structure.",
          "Epoxides are important materials that are broadly utilized as precursors for the production of different valuable polymers, in particular, cyclic carbonates [26] or epoxy resins. Mild oxidation of olefines is one of the important methods to produce epoxides. Ti-containing zeolites are known to be effective catalysts for olefin epoxidation processes [27]. The mechanism of the reaction is known and described [28,29]. However, in a process involving “bulky” cyclic olefines molecules, such as cyclohexene or cyclooctene, the activity of microporous zeolites is extremely low, due to the diffusion properties and steric limitations of cyclic olefins [27]. The creation of materials with a developed external surface (hierarchical zeolites), and a high concentration of active sites on the external surface could result in a significantly improved catalytic activity of these materials.",
          "Over the past few decades, various methods of carbon dioxide utilization attracted the attention of researchers [30]. The scope of possible applications of CO2 includes the production of different valuable organic compounds such as methanol [31], organic carbonates (dimethyl carbonate, cyclic carbonates) [32], carbamide [33] and diethyl ether [34]. Among these products, cyclic carbonates are very interesting due to their further usability as monomers to produce biodegradable polymers [35], solvents for lithium-ion batteries [36] etc. In industry, the production of cyclic carbonates includes reactions of organochlorine substances (phosgene, diphosgene) with cyclic epoxides and diols [37]. Besides that, a set of less dangerous and more ecological methods, including interactions of carbon dioxide with diols [38,39], epoxides [40,41] and olefins [42,43], were developed. The last of the mentioned reactions is a two-step process that requires the use of additional oxidants for its first stage – the reaction of the epoxidation of double bonds [42,44]. The resulting epoxide reacts with CO2 and forms cyclic carbonate in the second step of the reaction. Efficient catalysts for the first step are different oxides of transition metals (Mo [45], Ti [46]), hydrotalcites [47], titanium-containing zeolites [43,48,49], and mesoporous molecular sieves [50,51]. For the first stage, the presence of vacant electron orbitals (for example, unfilled d-orbitals) is important as there, activation of oxidants (hydrogen peroxides or organic peroxides) occurs [52–54]. For the second stage, Lewis base sites from different types of materials (homogeneous quaternary ammonium halides, metal-organic frameworks as ZIF-8 [55], cerium [56] and magnesium oxides [57], zeolites with Lewis basic sites, including titanosilicas [41]) can act as catalysts. Some of our team have recently shown that the second stage of the process can be successfully catalyzed via titanosilicate zeolites of the structural MTW-type (according to zeolite classification) and cesium-containing zeolites [58].",
          "In the present work, we apply spray-drying as a fast, convenient and scalable method to produce zeolite supraparticles, composed of 100 nm TS-1 nanoparticles. The few-microns size, nearly spherical shape, hierarchical structure composed of zeolite crystallites and secondary inter-crystallite transport mesopores, and also the presence of tetrahedral TiO4 sites in the zeolite framework make these supraparticles promising catalysts for different reactions, particularly for the cyclic carbonate synthesis from olefins."

          "In a typical procedure, 5.84 g of TPAOH solution was mixed with 2.42 g of deionized (DI) water in a 10 ml beaker. Separately, 4.08 g of TEOS was mixed with 0.100 ml of TBOT and stirred for several minutes. The TPAOH solution was added to the TEOS/TBOT mixture in small (0.5–1.0 ml) portions under continuous stirring. This resulted in a clear solution that was left to stir for 1 h to complete hydrolysis of the ethers. The volume of the reaction mixture was fixed and the mixture was heated to 80 °C to evaporate the formed alcohol. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled down and diluted with water to make its volume equal to its volume before evaporation. The final composition of the reaction mixture is (in mol) 0.015TiO2-1SiO2-0.37TPAOH-19.23H2O. The mixtures were transferred to tightly closed 100 ml polypropylene bottles and placed in a drying oven at 80 or 90 °C. The hydrothermal treatment was carried out during 24 or 48 h.",

The supernatant was discharged while the precipitate was thoroughly redispersed in water under ultrasonic treatment, settled by centrifugation (10000 rpm, 15 min) and redispersed again (three times in total). The weight content of the solid phase in sol was determined from a small portion of liquid as a dry residue at 100 °C. Before the spray-drying, the sols were diluted by DI water to get the desired value of solid content.",

To prepare nano-crystalline TS-1, the reaction mixtures after treatment at 80 or 90 °C, centrifugation and washing, as described above, was precipitated by centrifugation and dried overnight at 100 °C.",

Adsorption data were treated using standard software of the instrument. The specific surface areas were estimated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, the data ranges for fitting were chosen to meet the Rouquerol criteria [60]; due to large fraction of the micropores in the samples typical range appeared p/p0 = 0.005–0.1.

          "The size and crystallinity of the primary zeolite NPs, which are determined by the conditions of hydrothermal synthesis, are the first variables, influencing the structure of the purposed supraparticles. The formation of primary NPs takes place starting from the initial sol, however, their size and crystallinity strongly depend on the temperature of aging. Particularly, sol aging at 80 °C resulted in nearly-amorphous titanosilicate TS-N80, while aging either at 90 °C or at 175 °C yields particles of MFI-type structures (according to zeolite classification), indicated in XRD by its characteristic reflexes at 2θ = 7.9, 8.7, 23.4 and 23.9° [59] (Fig. 1 a).",
          "The sizes of zeolite crystallites were determined using the Scherrer equation; the width of the reflex at 23.4° for final samples, calcined at 550 °C, was used for the calculations. For “standard” TS-1 zeolite the crystallite size is 32 nm, for the sample SP-1, prepared from non-purified nanoparticles, it is equal to 16 nm while for all other samples, prepared from purified sols (TS-N90, SP-2 to SP-4) it is in a range of 20–21 nm. Additionally, the formation of the MFI phase could easily be detected by the FTIR adsorption band at 550 cm−1, assigned to 5-membered rings of the MFI structure [63]. This band is clearly seen in the spectra of all the samples, aged at 90 or 175 °C, while for the amorphous sample, aged at 80 °C this band is very weak (Fig. 1b).",
          "The size distribution of zeolite NPs, determined by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2 a), is relatively narrow with a distribution maximum value, increasing with a hydrothermal treatment temperature and time. This maximum appeared at 70 nm for the particles aged at 80 °C for 24 h, at 85 nm for the ones aged at 90 °C for 24 h, at 100 nm for 90 °C and 48 h, while for “standard” TS-1 zeolite, prepared at 175 °C for 48 h, the DLS particle size is 220 nm. The results of SEM characterizations (Fig. 2b and c) are in line with the DLS data. The TS-1 (aged at 175 °C for 48 h) is composed of relatively large (approx. 220 nm) well-faceted nanoparticles, connected with each other in a statistical order. The interparticle pores of 50–1000 nm size should be considered as the macropores. The TS-N90 sample (aged at 90 °C for 48 h) consisted of 100 nm nearly spherical particles with smooth edges, indicating polycrystallinity of the particles or the presence of an amorphous phase on their surface. The particles formed a relatively tight structure with interparticle mesopores and macropores."

          "According to all aforementioned, the ageing of primary zeolite particles at 90 °C was sufficient to achieve their crystallization, while lower temperatures resulted in amorphous particles. That is why the spray-drying experiments that are reported below were focused on the crystalline primary particles aged at 90 °C. For the very first sample (SP-1), an aged reaction sol was diluted from 5 to 15 ml and spray-dried to obtain supraparticles. The resulting sample consisted of 1–10 μm nearly-spherical supraparticles, composed of 100 nm primary NPs, embedded inside the matrix, which is probably an amorphous silicate (Fig. 3 ). In turn, the supraparticles are tightly glued together, giving a few tens of μm aggregates.",
          "Two complementary reasons can be considered as the cause for the observed morphology of the supraparticles. First of all, a significant quantity of monomeric and oligomeric silicates and titanosilicates, not included in the crystalline primary particles, could be present in the reaction mixture, aged at 90 °C. High temperature during spray-drying accompanied by fast water removal with the stream of hot air promotes condensation of soluble silicates, yielding an amorphous “glue”. Secondly, the solution used for spray-drying contains a relatively high concentration of the strong base TPAOH. So, partial dissolution of primary zeolite particles as well as hydroxylation of their surface could take place at the initial stages of the spray-drying, “freeing” and providing the silicates that are responsible for the particles “gluing” at the later stages.",
          "When the spray-drying procedure was applied for the sol of the nanoparticles that were purified well via centrifugation and redispersion, the morphology of resulting supraparticles (Fig. 4 ) appeared significantly different from the ones discussed above. In the case of using “purified nanoparticles”, the primary particles are tightly packed within the supraparticles forming interparticle mesopores; no macropores and no “gluing” amorphous phases are observed. The supraparticles possess a spherical shape with a broad size distribution (2–10 μm).",
          "There are no stuck particles; however numerous crashed supraparticles and small aggregates of few primary particles are present, indicating relatively weak bonding between the primary NPs. Final calcination at 550 °C seems to not influence the supraparticle structure, so probably the bonds between primary particles are formed at the time of the spray-drying processes. Supraparticles (SP-2, SP-3, and SP-4) of identical structure are formed upon spray-drying using the purified sols, under the studied variations of synthesis conditions (sol aging and spray-drying regime). The only difference that was noticed was an increase in the fraction of crashed supraparticles and in the small aggregates fraction with an increased concentration of primary particles in the sol used for spray-drying. So, the key factor, influencing the morphology of supraparticles, is the presence or absence of unreacted silicates and other low-molecular compounds at the spray-drying stage (i.e., SP-1 versus the other three supraparticle samples)."

          "The parameters of the supraparticle porous structures, such as the surface area, porous size distribution and pore volume were analyzed via N2 ad(de)sorption isotherms (Fig. 5 ) and summarized in Table 2 . According to the IUPAC classification [64], the isotherm of the TS-1 sample is close to the type I, peculiar for microporous samples. The isotherms of the supraparticles relate to type IV with the hysteresis loop of H4 type for the “glued” sample SP-1 and of H1 type at very high p/p0 for all other supraparticles (SP-2 to 4).",
          "Here SBET is a specific surface area, calculated from BET equation, Vs is a total pore volume at p/p0 = 0.995, Vmicro is a micropore volume from t-plot method and Sext is the mesopore and external specific surface area from the t-plot method.",
          "All studied samples possess a significant fraction of micropores. Among them, the reference zeolite TS-1, prepared at 175 °C and “glued” supraparticles SP-1 possess the lowest micropores volumes, for the last one due to the dilution of the microporous zeolite moiety with the interparticle silicate “glue”.",
          "The presence of micropores resulted in high values of SBET (Table 2), which combine the quantities of N2, adsorbed inside the micropores at low p/p0, and adsorbed on the surface of mesopores and external surface. The value of Vs corresponds to the volume of entirely all pores, which could be filled due to nitrogen capillary condensation, including the mesopores and part of the macropores. To get insight into the mesoporous structure of the sample, the values of Sext, representing the mesopores surface area and the BJH pore size distributions from the desorption part of the isotherm (Fig. 5b and c), representing the size of mesopore entrances in accordance with the bottle-like pore model were considered.",
          "The isotherm shape, micropore volume and porous structure parameters of TS-1 are typical for the MFI type zeolites. Low values of Sext and negligible fractions of mesopores, responsible for N2 capillary condensation in p/p0 = 0.40–0.95 range, are in line with the sample structure (an aggregate of 220 nm particles), shown in Fig. 2b. The wide maximum of pore size distribution, seen in Fig. 5c for TS-1, corresponds to pore entrances, formed in the close contact of zeolite nanoparticles.",
          "At the same time, for all the samples produced from TS-1 sols, aged at 90 °C, a significant fraction of mesopores is present. Among them, the “glued” supraparticles SP-1 possess the largest area (242 m2/g) and the narrowest size (4.4 nm) of the mesopores (Fig. 5b). These values indicate that the amorphous phase, connecting primary particles, consisted of mesoporous titanosilicate, formed at the spray-drying stage from unreacted or redissolved components.",
          "The samples prepared from purified nanoparticle sols demonstrate modest values of Sext and large sizes of the mesopores with wide multimodal distributions, corresponding to the irregular shape of inter-particular pore entrances (Fig. 5c). Nano-crystalline zeolite, prepared without spray-drying (TS-N90), have larger pore volume and Sext than the supraparticles (SP-2, 3 and 4). Probably, the spray-drying induces a closer packing of the primary particles in comparison with the drying in the oven, used for the TS-N90 synthesis. As a result, narrow mesopores on the edges between the primary particles, present in the TS-N90, could disappear in the supraparticles, giving smaller external surface areas (Table 2) and BJH pore size distribution maximums at large diameters (Fig. 5c) for the latter. Anyway, the volume and size of the mesopores either for TS-N90 or for the supraparticles produced from purified sols, is sufficient to ensure efficient diffusion of the reactants through the supraparticle."

          "The theoretical mass fraction of titanium in the prepared samples, calculated from the composition of the reaction mixture in the assumption of a total conversion of all used alkoxides into corresponding oxides, is equal to 1.17 wt%. The values of Ti content in the studied samples, as detected via ICP-OES, are listed in Table 2. The values for TS-1 and for the “glued” sample SP-1, prepared from the non-purified sol, are close to the ones calculated from the titanium content in the reaction mixture. The slight difference observed could be explained by an experimental error of ICP-OES and the presence of adsorbed water and silanol groups in the samples. On the contrary, for the samples produced from the purified sol, the concentration of Ti is only ∼33 % of the theoretical value. Hence, when the sol aging takes place at 90 °C, a significant fraction of Ti is not included in the NPs of zeolite, but remains in the solution. This feature seems important for understanding the zeolite formation processes; however, as it lies out of the scope of the present research, it was not analyzed in further detail and just taken as given. For the TS-N90 sample that was produced from centrifugated nano-crystallites of zeolites, the concentration of titanium was determined to be twice as low as for the “purified” supraparticles (SP-2 to 4).",
          "The coordination state of Ti atoms within the silicate matrix was analyzed by the DR-UV spectroscopy method (Fig. 6 a). It should be noted that in literature, there do exist several controversial interpretations regarding titanosilicate adsorption bands, however all of them agree that an increase in the Ti coordination number and TiOx clusterization results in an increase in adsorption band wavelength. So, based on several sources [65–68], we suggest the following band assignment: the band at 210–220 nm belongs to perfect tetrahedral TiO4 sites, isolated in a silica matrix, while for distorted tetrahedral Ti-sites (like TiO3-OH), it shifts to the 220–235 nm region. The bands of penta- and hexacoordinated titania lay at 230–260 nm [65] or 260–290 nm [67] ranges, which can be shifted for different titanosilicates. The bands near 290–300 nm belong to small TiOx clusters, while the band near 330 nm belongs to the anatase phase. To distinguish different Ti-sites, the experimental spectra were deconvoluted into Gauss components that are centered near 217, 240 (if necessary), 260 and 300 nm. The fraction of tetrahedral Ti-sites, calculated as a ratio of the band at 217 nm to the overall peak area, is presented in Table 3 and discussed together with the results of acidity measurements.",
          "The spectrum of the TS-1 reference zeolite consisted of one relatively narrow band with a maximum at 217 nm, corresponding to isolated tetrahedral [TiO4] sites, which are responsible for the TS-1 catalytic activity in epoxidation: the intensities of all other bands in this spectrum are negligible. The spectrum of the “glued” supraparticles SP-1 is significantly broader, being composed of the bands with maxima at 215 nm (isolated [TiO4] sites in zeolite) 240 nm (distorted tetrahedral Ti sites) and 250–270 nm (five- or six-coordinated Ti atoms). The relative intensity of the band of isolated [TiO4] species is quite low, while the intensity of the bands at higher wavelengths is maximized compared to all discussed materials. In general, the spectrum of SP-1 is more similar to the spectra of the mesoporous titanosilicates, presented earlier in numerous works [65–68], than to the spectrum of TS-1. The spectra of the TS-N90 and the supraparticles SP-2, SP-3 and SP-4, prepared from purified sols, are similar to each other. They reveal an intense band of isolated [TiO4] sites, the band of [TiO5] and [TiO6] sites at 260 nm and a low-intensity band of small TiOx clusters, while the band of distorted [TiO4] species is negligibly low. So, the majority of Ti atoms in these samples are included into the zeolitic framework of primary particles. The relatively large intensity of the band of both [TiO5] and [TiO6] species for the SP-2 sample indicates that it possesses a less ordered structure than the other samples, probably caused by the shorter time of its hydrothermal treatment (24 h vs 48 or 54 h).",
          "According to all aforementioned, it could be concluded that the active tetrahedral [TiO4] sites are stabilized mainly in a zeolite framework of primary NPs, while [TiO5] and [TiO6] sites as well as small [TiOx] extra-framework clusters, which are mostly inactive in epoxidation [69], accumulate in the amorphous mesoporous titanosilicate glue between the NPs.",
          "The chemical nature of the surface sites of the materials was studied by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Fig. 6b). The presence of pyridine (Py) molecules on the titanosilicate surface resulted in the appearance of ν 19b (1446 cm−1), ν 19a (1490 cm−1) and ν 8b (1577 cm−1) bands of Py molecules adsorbed either on Lewis acid sites (LAS) or H-bonded on the terminal ≡ Si-OH groups. At the same time, the band at 1545 cm−1, which corresponds to ν 19b vibrations of Py, adsorbed on the Bronsted acid cites, is completely absent in the spectra, which is in line with previous data on Py, adsorbed on TS-1 [62]. The band of ν 8a vibrations near 1600 cm−1 consists of two components, corresponding to H-bonded Py (1596 cm−1) and Py adsorbed on LAS (1608 cm−1). The concentration of Py on LAS (CLAS) and their molar fraction among all Py-adsorbing sites (χLAS) (Table 3) were calculated from the areas of Gauss components after the deconvolution of ν 8a band, using the value of the molar extinction coefficient ε 1608(Ti-LAS Py) = 0.71 cm μmol−1 from Ref. [62] and assuming the same value for ε 1596(H-bonded Py).",
          "CLAS 150 – concentration of LAS from Py adsorption at 150 °C; χLAS = I1608/(I1608+I1596) – molar fraction of LAS at 150 °C;",
          "The concentrations and molar fractions of the chemical functionalities, which may have influenced the catalytic activity of the titanosilicates, are summarized in Table 3. The molar fraction of tetrahedral [TiO4] sites (χTiO4) is close to 1 for “standard” TS-1 zeolite with a well-crystallized framework. The value of χ(TiO4) remains relatively high (0.68–0.83) for the samples prepared from purified sols (TS-N90, SP-2, SP-3 and SP-4), while it is the lowest for the “glued” SP-1 sample, composed of primary zeolite NPs and amorphous titanosilicate. The concentration of LAS, adsorbing Py at 150 °C (CLAS 150), decreases in the order TS-1 ≫ SP-1 > SP-2 > SP-4 > SP-3 ≫ TS-N90, reaching a maximum for “standard” TS-1 and a minimum for TS-N90 with lowest Ti content. CLAS 150 correlates with the product of titanium concentration (CTi) and χ(TiO4), confirming the attribution of LAS to coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites in the zeolitic framework [62], which are commonly considered as active sites of epoxidation. The desorption of Py under evacuation at 250 °C resulted in the approximately 3–5 times decrease of Py-LAS absorption band at 1608 cm−1 for all the samples except SP-1, where it remains nearly constant probably due to diffusion limitations.",
          "The molar fraction of LAS (χLAS) decreases in the sequence TS-1 ≫ SP-3 ∼ SP-4 ≫ SP-2 > TS-N90 > SP-1. For “standard” TS-1 with relatively low concentration of hydroxyls, LAS are the main sites of Py adsorption. For the samples SP-3 and SP-4, the χLAS value is lower due to their hierarchical nature with an increased concentration of OH-groups, probably located on the external surface of primary nanoparticles (Table 2). The shorter aging time of zeolite NPs (SP-2 sample) resulted in further decrease of χLAS, originated from a larger quantity of hydroxyls in SP-2 in comparison with SP-3 and SP-4 due to the possible presence of hydroxyl nests. At the same time, values of CLAS for SP-2, 3 and 4 are close to each other. A minimal value of χLAS for TS-N90 and SP-1 takes place due to low CLAS caused by a low Ti content in TS-N90, and the presence of hydroxylated amorphous titanosilicate with a large surface area in SP-1.",
          "Since Lewis acid sites can act as active centers in olefins epoxidation, it is reasonable to expect noticeable effects of their concentration and availability on the catalytic activity of a material in the reaction of styrene cyclocarboxylation. However, the strength and probably the catalytic activity of acid sites (e.g. LAS) in the hierarchical zeolites might be different from those in the bulk zeolite analogs [71]."

          "The synthesized materials were tested as catalysts for cyclic styrene carbonate (4-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one) synthesis from styrene and carbon dioxide under pressure (30 atm) in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) as a co-catalyst of the second reaction stage (see Scheme 1 ). This two-step reaction is a way to produce cyclic carbonates for different applications [70], e.g. aprotic solvents, intermediates for pharmaceuticals and fuel additives.",
          "Before the study of titanosilicates, preliminary tests of the reaction mixture were performed. If the reaction mixture was heated in the absence of solid catalyst, the conversion of styrene was below 1 %, the same was true for styrene epoxide, heated in absence of zeolite and TBAI. At the same time, heating of styrene epoxide in the reaction mixture with TBAI and without zeolite gives 98.4 % conversion with 99 %+ selectivity to the desired styrene carbonate. So, the presence of titanosilicate is necessary for the proceeding of the first reaction stage, while the second stage goes smoothly under activation by dissolved TBAI, which correlates well with the literature data [72].",
          "In Fig. 7 a we represent the catalytic characteristics (styrene conversion, selectivity and yield for purposeful cyclic carbonate) of titanosilicate samples prepared by the different methods. For most of the samples, the styrene conversion is very high, exceeding 97 %, while the sample SP-1 demonstrates a lower conversion: 86 %. At the same time, this sample shows the highest selectivity (97 %), which is significantly lower (36–79 %) for all other samples. As a result, the yield of the target reaction product, 4-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, varied in the range of 36–83 %.",
          "Comparing the catalytic characteristics of the studied samples, one could note that the performance of the samples SP-2, SP-3, SP-4, and TS-N90 is similar, while the samples TS-1 and SP-1 differ significantly. The sample TS-1 is an ordinary titanosilicate bulk zeolite of the MFI structural type with a very small (9 m2/g, Table 2) specific external surface. It demonstrates abnormally low selectivity in the formation of cyclic carbonate and high styrene conversion. On the contrary, the sample of “glued” supraparticles SP-1 possesses a large outer surface (242 m2/g) and a relatively low content of tetrahedral titanium (Table 3, Fig. 6a). This sample shows the lowest conversion of styrene among all titanosilicates we studied, but the highest selectivity for the target product. All other samples, i.e., the nano-crystalline TS-N90 and the supraparticles SP-2, SP-3 and SP-4, prepared from the purified nanoparticles sol, yield a selectivity, which is intermediate between the TS-1 and SP-1, and nearly 100 % styrene conversion except the TS-N90, giving 97 % conversion due to decreased overall Ti concentration.",
          "Observed differences in catalytic performance can be explained in view of the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. Cyclic carbonate production from styrene is a tandem reaction, the first stage of which is the oxidation of styrene to styrene epoxide by tert-butyl alcohol hydroperoxide, catalyzed by Lewis acid sites, i.e. tetrahedral TiO4 sites accessible on the surface and stabilized in the silica framework. Taking into account the size of the molecules (styrene, styrene epoxide and tert-butyl alcohol hydroperoxide) and the size of the cavities at the intersection of the MFI structure channels, it can be assumed, that the epoxidation occurs both on the outer surface and inside the micropores. It is expected that a large outer surface should contribute to the growth of styrene conversion; however, a more important factor affecting the conversion rate is probably the concentration of the active centers (tetracoordinated Ti(IV) sites).",
          "The second stage of the reaction is the transformation of styrene epoxide into the corresponding cyclic carbonate, easily proceeding in the homogeneous phase with the participation of a TBAI catalyst. The mechanism of this reaction [72,73] requires the simultaneous presence of a Lewis base (iodide anion in the case of TBAI) to provoke the opening of the oxirane ring, and a cation or a Lewis acid site to stabilize an intermediate, which contains an anionic oxygen fragment and which is capable of carbon dioxide addition to form a substituted carbonate anion. This stage is followed by cyclization and release of the catalyst species and cyclic carbonate molecule.",
          "Taking into account the large size of the TBAI cation, it does not migrate inside the zeolite micropores. Besides that, the formation of a substituted carbonate anion inside the micropores, for example under the simultaneous action of LAS (tetracoordinated Ti(IV) sites) and a Lewis base (iodide anion or surface basic site such as bridging oxygen of zeolite framework), seems unrealistic due to relatively large size of this intermediate. So, the second stage of the reaction could occur either in the solution, as it happens in the absence of a heterogeneous catalyst, or on the external surface of zeolite crystallites. A possible factor, influencing its rate, is the desorption of styrene epoxide from zeolite micropores. Logically, the small size of zeolite primary particles and their large outer surface will accelerate this process and facilitate the formation of cyclic styrene carbonate from epoxide. At the same time, the long stay of the epoxide inside the micropores, where it is unavailable for TBAI, could cause side reactions of its hydrolysis to phenyl ethylene glycol and subsequent oxidation to ketoalcohols and ketaldehydes by an excess of oxidant, seen as the conversion by-products.",
          "The dependence of the styrene conversion on the product of the concentration (expressed as a mole fraction of tetracoordinated Ti(IV) sites according to DR-UV data) and the value of the specific surface area is shown in Fig. 7b. As can be seen from the figure, the conversion increases with a product value of χ(TiO4)·SBET growth, asymptotically reaching 100 % when it exceeds about 400. The physical meaning of this dependence is that upon reaching a certain threshold concentration of available active sites in the given conditions and reaction time, the first stage of the tandem process is complete.",
          "The dependence of the selectivity to the target reaction product, 4-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one, on the external specific surface value, is represented in Fig. 7c. As can be seen from the figure, this correlation has a similar character to the previous case: an increase in the specific external surface value has a dramatic effect on the selectivity for the target reaction product (maximum for SP-1 samples). A possible interpretation of this dependencies is the following: a higher outer surface causes a higher rate of desorption and diffusion from the surface and micropores of zeolite into the liquid phase. It results in a higher concentration of epoxide in the solution, leading to a higher rate of the target cyclic carbonate formation. Vice versa, a low outer surface, such as in TS-1, causes difficulties in diffusion and desorption of the epoxide, retarding its interaction with TBAI and facilitating side reactions of epoxide hydrolysis and partial oxidation as a result.",
          "So, according to our data, the key factor, affecting the total conversion of styrene to styrene epoxide is the concentration and accessibility of tetrahedral TiO4 sites. We found a correlation between the total conversion and fraction of tetrahedral TiO4 sites in a sample as well as with the product of tetrahedral Ti content and BET surface area. For the selectivity, the steric factors and external surface of samples appeared more crucial. The first stage of the reaction probably occurs fast and its product, the styrene epoxide, has to react with CO2 and a co-catalyst (I−-ions) within the bulky molecule of TBAI. For this purpose, the mesoporous structure, allowing to adsorb tetrabutylammonium iodide and styrene epoxide, gives more opportunities to direct transformations of epoxide to styrene carbonate. In the case of samples with lower external surfaces, side reactions caused by epoxide interaction with excess oxidant, rearrangements etc. became more important.",
          "Finally, it should be mentioned that for supraparticles, the primary particles are very similar to TS-N90 by their size and shape, so, the differences in catalytic performances between TS-N90 and supraparticles could arise mainly due to the differences in their secondary hierarchical structure."

The NPs properties depend strongly on the aging temperature: only amorphous particles formed at 80 °C, while well-crystalline approximately 100 nm TS-1 NPs could be prepared at 90 °C. High temperature (175 °C) resulted in large 220 nm TS-1 nanoparticles. However, the TS-1 NPs prepared at 90 °C are depleted in Ti (only 1/3 of its theoretical concentration accumulates in the particles).",

When the initial sol of primary TS-1 NPs was spray-dried, the NPs were found to be embedded in a matrix of amorphous mesoporous titanosilicate; if the nanoparticles were preliminary purified from low-molecular components, the supraparticles that formed upon spray-drying contained exclusively zeolite nanocrystallites. The Ti atoms in zeolite NPs exist as isolated tetrahedral [TiO4] sites, while in amorphous titanosilicate they exist as highly coordinated TiOx units and small TiO2 clusters.",

It was shown that the conversion rate inclines with an increase in the concentration of tetracoordinated Ti4+ sites and the specific surface area of a sample, and the selectivity for the target cyclic carbonate inclines with an increase in the specific external surface area."
